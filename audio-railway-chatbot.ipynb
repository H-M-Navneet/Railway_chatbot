Broad Classification of Goods Trains: \\n1. End to End:  \\nTrains, generally run from the train-originating Terminal  to the final destination. This is an express stream \\nof freight trains and does not require any stoppage en route, except  for crew change. \\nSuch trains will normally include contai ner trains, air braked block rakes for single destination . These trains \\nare planned to run like non stop Rajdhani trains and may have a fixed timetable and guaranteed transit \\ntime. This group may include trains of private freight operators. \\nOther through trains –Are also block rakes or may have two or more destinations on the same or adjacent \\nsection. These may have  conventional bogie stock \\n2. Work Trains, Shunting Trains, Pilots etc .: \\nThese train movements are for short distances for clearance of damaged wagons made fit or for \\nsupply/removal of rakes to and from the sidings or important terminals served by a yard. \\n3. Departmental trains : \\n These include Material Trains, Track maintenance trains, Ballast trains, Relief Trains, Wiring \\nSpecial, Crane Specials etc. are known as departmental trains. II. Complexity of Freight operations: Freight operation is generally more complex than pass enger train operations for the following reasons: \\n1. The changing pattern and fluctuations in demand fo r rakes/wagons due to changes in the level of \\nproduction, changes in the pattern of dist ribution and changed consumption centres.  \\n2. The variety of commodities to be moved, with different characteristics & type of wagons required \\n3. Preferential traffic schedules, rationalisat ion scheme& other public policy regulations  \\ni) Seasonal variations in demand \\nii) Time taken in loading/unloading–whether manual or mechanical \\niii) Train examination Systems  \\n• End to End/Intensive Examination \\n• Premium end to end \\n• C.C. rake \\nThis in turn results in -Sick Wagon detachments & attachment of fit wagons for completing the rake \\ncomposition. \\n4. Following is the series of operations for empty rakes being offered for loading:- \\n• Examination  \\n• Supply/placement  \\n• Loading \\n• Despatch \\n5. For inward loaded trains which after placement and release have to be back loaded at the same \\nterminal or at other location, withdrawal from loading points may require an outward examination unless \\nthe rake is fit for round trip or for a prescribed distance. \\nOnce the train is fit in all respects and commercial formalities have been complete a set of activities are \\ninitiated these include – \\n• Preparation of train documents \\n• Train ordering,  \\n• Arranging train crew & locomotive  \\n• Monitoring train movement  \\n• Arrival at the destination ', metadata={'source': 'operating manual-traffic.pdf', 'page': 18}), Document(page_content=' \\nThis cyclic operation requires constant monitoring and co-ordination. \\n \\nIII. Ordering of Goods Train : \\na) Each freight Train is required to be ordered to run under a unique number /name or Train \\nID for monitoring its movement through intermediate divisions, zones etc as also to \\nfacilitate all processes at control office s, yards, C&W depots station and Crew/Guard \\nbooking Lobby Power Controller/Traction Loco Controller. \\nb) The message from Divisional Control that a train is scheduled to leave from a Station or \\nYard at a certain time.  is known as the Train Notice.  The message is, in turn further conveyed to all concerned.  The availability of suitable (i) Load (ii) Locomotive (iii) Crew/Guard and (iv)  Path has to be kept in view for ordering of goods trains.   \\nc) Co-ordination between the Traffic Controller /and the Power Controller (the shed, if fresh \\npower is required) ; the Yard/Station, C&W st aff and the Crew/Guard booking lobby is thus \\nrequired. \\nd) Regular conference with yards, terminals,  and the adjoining Division is held by the Control \\nand for exchange of information regarding fore cast of trains in yards; completion of \\nloading/unloading at sidings etc. and interchange with adjoining Divisions.  This monitoring \\nshould be enforced through FOIS so that time  of staff spent on phone is reduced and more \\nproductive work is done by better planning. \\ne) Constant monitoring for expediting loading/unl oading at major sidings/goods sheds is also \\ndone by Control and the Station Staff for ensuring the availability of load. \\nIV. Planning of Locomotives:  \\na) Power Plan:  \\n The power plan indicates the daily average number of locos required and planned for freight \\nservices section wise for each division \\nThis bare requirement of Locos for Traffic use is calculated on the basis of the traffic turn round and \\naverage number of trains run on each section \\nThis represents the average number of locos needed on the Division. b) Loco Outage and Loco Utilisation:  Loco Outage means the average number of locos available to traffic use in a day (24 hours).  Since \\nthe Diesel and Electric Locos have long extended runs and may cover many divisions in a day, the position \\nmay be maintained graphically for the entire duration (0 to 24 hours) the loco is on line on the Division. \\nDifferent colour graphic representation on Bar Chart can represent the time spent by each Loco to serve as a good Management Information System e.g. (a) time taken by running train (b) time taken for Crew \\nChanging (c) time for Fuelling (Diesel Locos) (d) time taken for Loco inspection (e) time for repairs on line \\n(f) time for Light Engine running (g) time taken for Shunting (h) time spent at terminal/ destination (i) en-route detention. \\n Thus, the total hours for which the various Locos were available for Traffic use divided by 24 \\n(number of hours in a day) would give the Loco outage.  \\nLoco outage = Engine Hours for traffic use\\n \\n     2 4  \\n Loco outage can be prepared service-wise/shed-wis e/railway-wise, traction wise etc.  The actual \\nLoco outage should generally be around t he target fixed for each Division. \\n However, it should be appreciated that wh ile the target is based on average, the actual \\nrequirement of Locos may fluctuate due to bunching of  trains, increase in traf fic or due to bottlenecks on \\naccount of operational reasons, equipment failure or after effect of interruption to traffic. \\nc) Control of Operating Department on Loco running:  \\n Electric and Diesel Locos are maintained by the respective Loco Sheds and Locos once turned out \\nof shed are available for utilisation for a number of da ys till prescribed maintenance/inspection schedule is \\ndue in the shed or the locos require out of course  repairs.  Thus, while the operating staff has the \\noperational control over utilisation of Locos as well as  flexibility of using the Locos as per operational \\nrequirement, they have to keep in view the maint enance/inspection schedules of the Locos and send the \\nLocos to the Shed well in time.  Overdue running of locos should be avoided by suitably planning the train \\nrunning.  Similarly, all out efforts should be made to se nd the dead locos or locos requiring attention in the \\nhome shed.  The hauling capacity of the Locos and special restrictions as jointly agreed to by the officers of \\noperations and loco departments should also be adhered to. ', metadata={'source': 'operating manual-traffic.pdf', 'page': 19}), Document(page_content=' While operating department has to optimise the work done by each Loco i.e. moving maximum \\ntraffic with the minimum number of Locos by adopt ion of operational strategies and improving the \\nefficiency, the Shed and the Loco organisation should provide optimum number of Locos in good fettle, keeping in view the traffic needs as shortage of Loco s can lead to transport bottlenecks and inability to \\nmove the existing and potential traffic. \\n Along with the availability, reliability, safety and predictability have to be aimed.  Loco failures, \\nLoco troubles en-route and ineffective loco s should be kept to the bare minimum. \\n Balancing of Locos is also required to be done i.e. Locos without loads may be sent to other \\nDivisions where they are required. \\n Reduction in terminal detentions and increasing av erage speed of goods trains would substantially \\nimprove engine utilisation. d) Availability of Engine Crew and Guard:  \\nRunning staff for Goods operations are generally booked on the principle of first in and first out,  \\nBalancing of Crews/Guards by sending staff spare is al so required to be done in case the running of trains \\nis not even in both directions on a section. e) Availability of Path:  \\n Theoretically, on a double line section, a Goods Train can always be run when load, power and \\ncrew are available and the next block section is clear. \\n On single line sections despatching a train out  of path, will be counter productive, due to \\nMail/Express Blocks, Peak timings of Suburban or Commu ter traffic. Readiness of the interchange point or \\nthe terminal to accept the trains are to be kept in view before pushing a goods train ahead.  It is better to \\nhave directional flow if possible. \\n Master Charts incorporating all Passenger carrying trains and realistic goods train paths are \\nprepared in consultation with Operat ing Officers, Controllers, Yard Sta ff, Power Controller, Station Masters \\nof important stations etc. in order to: \\ni) Find out line capacity of the section. \\nii) To highlight the set of suitable paths for guidance of Control, which can be used for, goods \\ntrain ordering also. \\nIii To prepare tentative goods train time t able for selected express stream of trains. \\nf) Lobby System:  \\n A Lobby is like a Control Office in the field.  It is established with the twin aim of reducing engine \\ndetention and crew detention in a Yard  or a Crew or engine changing stati on by realistic ordering of trains \\nand Crew/Guard booking. \\n  It is advantageous to have a combined Crew and Guard booking lobby so that both are available \\nsimultaneously. The lobby supervisors/staff can take forecast of a train running from the Deputy \\nController/Section Controller along with details rega rding the names of Crew, Guard and their signing in \\ntime, loco particulars, last C&W examination etc.  \\n  They can verify the dates of Loco Schedules fr om the Chart available with them and keep liaison \\nwith the Power Controller/TLC. They also keep watc h on “expect” of train formation, examination, \\nreadiness etc. and by constant chasing, planning and updating of information, trains are ordered on \\nrealistic expect, Trains may be put back or cancelled, if required and Crew booking and engine allocation \\nchanged promptly.  \\n Some overlapping Crew/Guard may also be kept in  the Lobby to take care of the last minute \\nabsenteeism. Shunters may also be k ept in the Lobby of big yards/junctions to attach, detach, and run \\nround locos or to pull the Train from Yards upto the Cr ew changing points, so as to avoid wastage of main \\nline Loco pilots.  The pre-departure detention to the Crew, Crew hours balancing, rescheduling of Locos and Yard \\ndetentions to Locos can be thoroughly monitored by the Lobby and remedial measures taken. \\nV. Role of Various Agencies in Freight Operation:  \\nLarge number of agencies play important role in frei ght operation. Marshalling Yards, Train Examination, \\nLocomotives and Lobbies have been di scussed elsewhere in this Manual.  Role of a few agencies is \\ndiscussed below with special reference to freight operations. \\ni) Control Office:  \\nThe main function of the Control Office is planning, ex ecution and review with all the three activities going \\non simultaneously.  ii) Planning is aimed at forecasting and optimising the following:- ', metadata={'source': 'operating manual-traffic.pdf', 'page': 20}), Document(page_content='1. Interchange \\n2. Trains to be run section-wise \\n3. Supply of rakes/ for bulk loading,. \\n4. Release of inward loaded rakes placed for Unloading \\n Information regarding the following items is generally required for this purpose: \\n(a)  Analysis of divisional wagon holding \\n(b) Power availability \\n(c) Availability of loads \\n(d) Disposal of empty rakes  \\n(e) Demands for loading \\n The plan is made by Control in the early hours of morning and reviewed by Operating Officers. \\nChanges in the plan, as deemed necessary are made at  various stages on the basis of updated information \\nreceived from the activity centres, adjacent divisi ons and instructions received from the Head Quarters. \\niii) Execution:  \\nThe goods operation plan is executed on the basis of ac tual materialisation. of the forecast with suitable \\nadjustments made for short falls /excesses. \\nYards, Loco Sheds, Stations, Terminals, Lobbies and TX R depots are actively involved in execution of the \\nplan. iv) Review:  \\n The trend of the day’s position is reviewed by the Chief Controllers and Officers in the afternoon.  \\nDetailed review of the previous day’s performance is  carried out early in the morning by the Operating \\nOfficers with the following objectives: \\n1. Analysing shortfalls of previous day to take re medial measures and pin-point weak spots. \\n2. Provide data for planning for the current day. \\nThe main features of performance, which can be reviewed, include: \\n• Interchange failures \\n• Divisional Wagon Balance (Wagons on Division) \\n• Train Running  \\n• Disposition of empties \\n• Loading at important terminals – and in case of shortfall, reason for the same. \\n• Review of unusual occurrences \\n• Examination of Control Charts \\n• Particulars of stabled loads \\n• Yard performance \\n• Unloading on Division \\n• Registrations and Loading \\n• Power position, utilisation of Locos & Terminal detention \\n• Sick line working \\n• Special type of stock \\n• Clearance of piecemeal wagons (sick or otherwise) from roadside stations. \\nVI. Head Quarter’s Role in Freight Operations:  \\nThe Division’s Freight Operations generally require cl ose co-ordination and assistance from other Divisions \\nand Railways. While direct contact is also maintained by the Control and Operating Officers of various \\nDivisions, the Zonal Head Quarters play a pivotal role in this respect. Some of the functions performed by \\nthe Head Quarters are summarised below: \\nVII. Management Information System:  \\n1) Important information concerning the position of Freight Operations on various Divisions of \\nRailways is obtained through line and stock report daily telephonically or through FOIS or Teleprinter or \\nFAX to the Head Quarters (Centra l Control) from Divisional Contro l.  Now more and more zones and \\nRailway Board  are shifting to FOIS generated reports. \\n This includes, loading and stock position, particula rs of old outstanding and fresh registration of \\nindents, category wise position of unloading, transhipmen t, Yard balances, important yards and wagons on \\nDivisions, Train Running on each section, average speed, interchange position, Locomotive position and \\nLocomotive utilization etc.  ', metadata={'source': 'operating manual-traffic.pdf', 'page': 21}), Document(page_content=' The position is reviewed and analyzed by t he COM/CFTM/ Dy.COM (Goods), STM (Goods) \\nCMPE(R&L) and CELE. The important position pertaini ng to various Departments is conveyed to the \\nDepartments concerned as well as the General Manager. The Head Quarter Office also obtains the \\nStatements at the end of each month or whenever required and the performance is compared with (i) The \\nTargets (ii) The figures of the previous month (iii) The figures of the correspon ding month of the previous \\nyear and (iv) the best ever record etc. \\n In addition, the Statistical Branch also provides  Data to the General Manager and the Departments \\nconcerned with Operations for detailed analysis and review. \\n2. Head Quarters plays an important part in  planning and co-ordinating freight operations. After \\ndetailed conference with the Operating Officers, and in terms of Railway Boards current-operating \\ndirectives Head Quarters issues directions an d instructions regarding the following items: \\n(a) Interchange transactions (category wise) \\n(b) Loading and Unloading \\n(c) Traffic insight from other Railways/Divisions This information is now available on FOIS \\nterminal where a pipe line can be seen from end to end and expected arrival of train at destination is also estimated by FOIS system  \\n(d) Conveying priorities for the day and setting quantified objectives to be achieved. \\n(e) Reviewing the work done at the important ac tivity centres like Yards, Terminals etc. \\n(f) Train and Traffic regulation in  case of accidents etc. \\n(g) Certain items of Goods Operation are direct ly controlled by Head Quarters e.g. Co-\\nordination and directions regarding rake Loading of programmed and committed traffic, \\nmovement of special type of stock, movement  of over dimensioned consignments, out of \\nturn allotments and allotment despite restrictions etc.  \\nVIII. Railway Board’s Control on Freight Operations:  \\nThe Railway Board provides Unity of Control and di rection for the freight operations.  It also has the \\nimportant role of supervision and co-ordination, which is  very much essential for a big network like Indian \\nRailways. The Railway Board’s Control Office also re mains in contact with the Head Quarter (Central \\nControls) of the Zonal Head Quarters and watches loadi ng and movement of important  streams of traffic, \\nlike coal, raw material for steel plants (iron ore), cem ent, food grains, fertilisers, POL, sugar, export ores, \\ncontainer traffic etc.  It also watches loading, in terchange, power position, goods train running on important \\nsections etc. to ensure that each Railway fulfils its obligation and optimises the use of various assets. The \\nitems watched are more or less the same as those watched by the Zonal Head Quarters in respect of the \\nDivisions, but the perspective is wider. Railway Boar d plays an important co-ordinating role between \\nvarious Railways and other Central Government Depa rtments and vital sectors of Economy connected with \\nRailways. Policy formulation and Planning, which have im portant bearing on Freight Operations is also the \\nmajor function of the Railway board. \\nIX. Role of Some Other Departments: The Commercial Department plays an important role in canvassing for Traffic, improving marketing, \\ncustomer relations in general, booking of traffic, expediting loading/unloading of wagons, quick disposal of \\nunconnected wagons and transhipment of Wagon detach ed out of course for Hot Axles etc. The various \\nother Departments like Mechanical, Electrical, Civil Engineering and S&T provide and maintain various \\nassets and infrastructure (track, wagons, engines, S&T Network etc.). These departments also ensure \\nsufficient availability, reliability, predictability, safe ty and reduction in equipment failures; promptness in \\nrestoration in case of breakdowns and accidents should also be ensured. They also endeavour for the \\nachievements in technology upgradation along with the operating strategies and determine the level of excellence in Railway Operations to a great extent. In  nutshell, all the functionaries have to work as a \\ndedicated team. \\nX. Some Indices of Freight Operation and Efficiency:  \\nThe important Operating Statistics, most of which  are indices of Operating efficiency, have been discussed \\nin detail later in this Manual (Operating Statistics). Some Indices of Freight Operations and efficiency are \\nhighlighted below: \\nXI. Wagon Holding:  \\nFor a given amount of originating loading and receipts of loaded wagons from other Railways and making an allowance for percentage of stock out of commission for repairs, etc., there is an optimum number of \\nwagons that a Railway, and separately its constituent divisions, should hold to maintain the fluidity of \\ntransport system.  More wagons than the optimum number might lead to increase in the repairs and \\nmaintenance percentage, heavier detentions to wagons  and trains and transport bottlenecks, i.e. more \\ncongestion in sidings, yards and sections without a pr oportionate increase in the tonnes lifted, or in the ', metadata={'source': 'operating manual-traffic.pdf', 'page': 22}), Document(page_content='efficiency of operations. Similarly, excessive shortage of Wagons may lead to loss of traffic. Proper \\nestimation and projection of requirement, proper planning and working at various stages of freight \\noperations is necessary for keeping wagon holding low. “Ineffective Stock” percentage should also be kept \\nminimum. \\ni) Interchange Balance:  \\nMaintenance of the interchange target is an indicati on of a Railway’s overall operating performance and its \\nefforts to meet inter railway obligations, hence interchange balance should not be very high, even when \\nmaximum trains are interchanged.  However, attempts  should be made to see that on busy sections, \\ninterchange is not only confined to few hour s of the day but uniformly distributed. \\nii) Load of trains:  \\nA train is a unit of transport.  Depending upon the load, suitable loco is provided for its haulage.  In order to \\nget the optimum use of motive power and to in crease the capacity utilisation and throughput, each \\nLocomotive is given a load approximately to the maximum hauling capacity, unless operating necessity \\nrequires utilisation of a loco for lesser load.  The stat ions should also ensure that wagons are loaded to the \\ncarrying capacity or the minimum weight prescribed for some commodities. \\niii) Loading and Unloading:  \\nTo optimise the loading is one of the most important items in freight operations because it is through \\nloading that Railway earns the maximum revenue.  Similarly, unloading is necessary so that wagon \\nbecomes available for next loading.  Reducing the time taken for loading/unloading by technology \\nupgradation and other strategies in co-ordinati on with the customers has to be endeavored. \\nIv) Empty Running:  \\nIdeally it is waste of transport capacity to run a wago n empty or with light load, but much of empty running \\nis inescapable on account of the unbalanced nature and qu antity of outward and inward traffic at terminals \\nand necessity of supplying empty wagons.  Certain special type of wagons for POL, Steel, Coal, Natural \\nGas, Ammonia, LPG etc. have to be gener ally run empty to the loading points. Operating skill lies in \\navoiding or reducing the extent of empty haulage and cr oss movements of simila r type of empty stock. \\nv) Despatch in Block Rakes:  \\nDespatching of wagons in small numbers always means transit delay while a block load can go direct to \\nthe farthest destination skipping many  yards, thereby eliminating det ention that the wagons might have \\nsuffered in the intermediate yards.  Piecemeal wagons passing through a number of marshalling yards, \\nwhere they have to be combined with other wagons to form train loads, cause huge amount of work for the \\nstaff and result in loss of efficiency, avoidable delay , anxiety and uncertainty regarding their arrival at \\ndestination.  Unit train movement, i.e. a train load consigned by single consignee to single consignor, is ideal.  Consignees can also be motivated to club their Indents to get trainload and block rakes. \\nAlso two points loading on same engine run can improve wagon usage.  Close circuit rake movement can \\nalso be resorted to between selected pair of stations or  rakes. Maintaining the purity of freight rakes has \\nalso to be ensured. \\nvi) Long Distance Trains:  \\nIt is an age-old principle of operations that full tr ain loads should be formed at the earliest point for the \\nlongest possible distance. Long distance trains shou ld have least stoppages like long distance passenger \\ntrains. Trains can also be run as “crack trains” or Link Train.   \\nA crack train/Link Train is a train when the same crew (and engine if possible) instead of “Signing off” at the \\nintermediate crew changing point works a train to farther junction.  Thus, a train running from Ujjain to \\nGodhra or vice versa without Crew/Guard change at Ratl am can be run as X ‘Crack’.  The Crew can also \\nbe utilised on ‘Crack’ basis when the same Crew perfor m a round trip without “Signing off” at the outstation \\nand is promptly provided a load so that Crew returns to its Head Quarters within normal duty hours. \\nvii) Wagon Turn Round:  \\nThe interval between two successive loadings calculat ed from the time a wagon is placed for loading till the \\ntime it again becomes available for reloading is the actual turn round.  As the calculations for individual \\nwagons in the manner stated above are not practicable,  the following statistical formula is generally used: \\n  Wagon Turn Round (T )   =             S\\n \\n           L + R  \\nWhere ‘S’ stand for the effective daily wagon holding or midnight wagon balance of a day (excluding sick, \\nPOH wagons in or waiting for shops, like departmental  wagons, wagons lent for departmental use, and the \\nwagons used for coaching traffic).  ‘L’ stands for the total number of wagons loaded on the \\nDivision/Railways plus the wagons loaded at Transhipm ent Point, ‘R’ stands for the total number of loaded \\nwagons received from other Railway/Divisions.  Thus, for example, if a Division loads 350 Wagons on BG (including 50 BG Wagons loaded through transhipment of MG Wagons), 150 inward loaded wagons are ', metadata={'source': 'operating manual-traffic.pdf', 'page': 23}), Document(page_content='received from other Divisions and its effective w agon holding at the end of the day (midnight) is 2250 \\nwagons, the Divisional Wagon turn round will be 4.5 days.  \\n    \\n       2250             2250     i.e.  ---------     =  --------  = 4.5 days WTR (Wagon Turn Round) \\n      350+150          500 \\n \\nviii) Detention to Trains and Wagons:  \\n(a) Detention to Trains: \\nA check on the detention to trains (1) outside signals or  at stations adjacent to Goods Terminals, (2) in \\nshunting operations at road side stations and (3) enroute detentions for various reasons should be \\nexercised regularly. \\n(b) Detention to Wagons: \\nClose watch should be kept on the areas, e.g. Marshal ling Yards, Goods Terminals, Stabling Points etc., \\nwhere wagons are likely to suffer avoidable detention during various phases.  Although this is watched \\nthrough periodical data, special attention should be paid to pockets, where piecemeal Wagons suffer \\nprolonged detention and often remain out of sight. \\nIx) Engine Utilisation:  \\nEngines being costly resources their utilization have to  be carefully monitored.  Some of the measures for \\nimproving Engine Utilizations are as under: \\n(a) Running of the Goods Trains on proper path:   For this, the Master Charts have to be \\nproperly framed and consolidated. \\n(b) Proper co-ordinat ion between Control and Line Staff. \\n(c) Reduction in Terminal detention of Locos by  proper monitoring co-ordination and working \\nof Yard Staff, C&W Staff etc. \\n(d) Judicious ordering of Trains and Right  time starts of Goods Trains. \\n(e) Proper controlling, judicious crossings and preferences. \\n(f) Loop Lines on critical block sections should not be generally blocked. \\n(g) Stabling and picking up of load should be judicious and properly planned.  \\n(h) Loco pilot should run at maximum permissible speed subject to restrictions. \\n(i) Light Engines can be coupled or attached to trains in order to save path and energy. \\n(j) Light Engines (Single or Couple) should run at  maximum permissible speed, for which they \\nare fit, subject to speed restrictions \\n(k)  Signals must be taken off promptly at Stations. Distant/Warner Signals must always be \\ntaken off promptly. \\n(l) Tangible authority to proceed should be handed over at the appointed place instead of \\ngetting the train slowed down in front of the Station for handing over the Authority from the \\nPlatform. \\n(m) Trains should be run through Main Line (as far as possible) since looping results in extra time on run. \\n(n) Locomotives should be in good working order and staff should be well versed in Loco operations and trouble shooting. \\n(o) Hauling capacity of the Locomotives should be properly utilised.   \\n(p) Engineering speed restrictions should be regularly reviewed and reduced by maximising the output of the Engineering staff and machines.  Due care and foresight in offering blocks \\nfor track maintenance should be exercised.   \\n(q) Regular foot plating by officers and staff involved in operations, motivates train crew and \\nalerts the line staff. \\n(r)\\n Effective control over traffic yards to r educe other engine hours, detention to locos at \\nimportant loading/unloading points and industrial sidings. \\n(s) The factors adversely affecting the Locomotiv e utilisation, speed of goods train, terminal \\ndetention etc. should be got analysed by suitable multi departmental teams and remedial \\nmeasures taken. \\n(t) Incentive schemes for motivation of staff connected with Goods Operation, so as to \\nimprove Engine utilisation Special watch on Loco pilots loosing time on run and not \\nrunning on maximum permissible speed. \\nx) Average Speed of Goods Trains:  ', metadata={'source': 'operating manual-traffic.pdf', 'page': 24}), Document(page_content=' The average speed of goods trains is calculated by the following formula:- \\n       Average No. of Goods Trains X Distance travelled by each train in 24 hrs. Speed     =   Total time taken \\nby all the Goods Trains run. \\n   \\nThe distance and the time taken are calculated from  the Control Charts.  Thus all detention to Goods \\nTrains enroute enters into calculation and has t he effect of bringing down the average speed.  \\n Almost all the factors affecting engine utilisation pl ay part in the average speed of goods trains, the \\ndifference being that in the calculation of average speed of goods trains, the detent ion at originating point \\nand terminating point as well as the Light Engine  Running are not taken into consideration. While \\ncomputing average speed of freight trains \\nXII. Staff Supervisions:  \\nExcellence in freight operations requires that the sta ff offer their willing co-operation. To achieve this \\nproper training for constantly developing the knowledge, skills and commitment is essential.  \\n \\nXIII. Targets and Statistics:  \\n One of the important means to utilise fully and effi ciently the existing carrying capacity of a railway \\nis to set measurable and specific targets for the various  performances after taking into consideration all the \\nlocal conditions. Once the targets are laid down, al l possible efforts must be made to attain them. \\n The targets should be set sufficiently high and reviewed constantly with a view to improving the \\nperformance further.  Details regarding Statistics pertaining to Railway Operations are given in chapter on \\nOperating Statistics where targets are not attained with in a reasonable period, the causes must be traced \\nand effective remedial action taken, if nece ssary, revised targets should be laid down.

It controls the asset \\nmanagement of the Railways, in a dynamic situation, r ound the clock incessantly moving trains on its entire \\nnetwork. \\nIt has come a long way from being an exclusively telephone based system emerging in the form of an \\nInformation Technology enabled organization. This basic structure of Operating Control on Indian Ra ilways exists at the Divisional Level, which has also \\nbeen extended to Area Control levels.   In addition, C entral Control Office is situated in the headquarters \\noffice and one at Railway Board. \\nThe area spread of a division is divided into cont rol sections, each section having a given number of \\nstations.  \\nThe two-way telephone system, also called an omnibus ci rcuit which permits all stations to have direct \\ncommunication with Section Controller, who is responsible for train regulation in his area. The section \\nController can speak to all stations at the same ti me or to one station selectively, using individual \\nnumbers/buttons.   Movement of trains is plotted on a time distance graph to record their actual progress, \\nthese records, called control charts, can be analyzed later. \\nTo guide and assist the section controlle r, there are shift Deputy Controllers. \\nAll technical disciplines involved in train movement have a representative in the Control office to provide \\nthe required support from his department.

Introduction and Definition:  \\nA Yard can be defined by the functions it performs. It is the place or the activity centre on a Railway \\nsystem, where the trains or rolling st ock or group of rolling stocks are received, reformed into trains or \\nloads after marshalling and are despatched to their destinations. A Yard is, thus, a classifying and \\ndistributing machine with facilities for receiving, sorting and despatching the wagons to their various \\ndestinations, after the prescribed attention. This necess arily involves detention to trains and wagons, but it \\nis inherent in railway working to have Marshalling Yards.  \\nA Yard is a specified area laid out with a network of tracks divided into several grids for receiving sorting, \\nforming and despatching of trains. \\nII. N ecessity and Significance of Marshalling Yards:  \\n Though Yards perform very important functions, yet the work done in a Marshalling Yard is only \\nindirectly productive. Yards are operational necessity  and are even considered as necessary evils.   The \\ningenuity of the operating man consists in putting in the minimum number of the wagons into the minimum \\npossible number of Marshalling Yards by forming trains for the farthest common points subject to rules and \\nregulations. If the control is analogous to brain of the operating system, a large Marshalling Yard is a kin to \\nthe heart and its working to be planned and monitored with considerable care.  Constant vigilance and \\nintelligent and efficient work in day-to-day functions is required as it is one of the important factors \\ngoverning the capacity and the output  of a section. A Marshalling Yard affects not only the traffic it deals \\nwith, but also the entire train running on the section,  in particular and the working of Railway system in \\ngeneral. The Yard gets easily congested if treated as a holding Yard and if more trains are put in than \\ntaken out.   \\nIII. Classification of Yards:  \\n Yards can be classified as: \\n1. Terminal Yard \\n2. Marshalling Yard. \\n \\nIV. Terminal Yard:  Terminal Yard means the Yard attached to terminal goods sheds where large \\nnumber of wagons are loaded and/or unloaded.  This term is also used for every goods Yard, where a \\ngoods train terminates. \\nV. Marshalling Yard:   Yards are nominated as Marshalling Yards on the basis of the work done and \\nwagons dealt with. The Yard which receive and despatch trains without any shunting on them are classified \\nTransit Yard . In such Yard generally change of Crew, Engine or C&W examination etc. only take place in \\naddition to formations of a few loads. During the last  50 years such yards have become anachronistic and \\nhave given way to modern freight terminals the world over .  Therefore, this description has value (1) as a \\nhistorical document (2) as also as guidelines for effi cient working of modern freight terminals, described at \\nthe end of this chapter. \\ni) Objectives of Marshalling Yards:  \\n1.      Quick Transit viz . \\n(a) Accepting trains without detention at adjacent station outside the Yard. \\n(b) Minimising the detention to wagons in the Yard. \\n(c) Timely supply and placement/removal of wagons to the goods shed, transhipment shed, \\nrepacking shed, sidings, carriage and wagon s depots etc. served by the Yards. \\n(d) Forming block loads for the farthest destination. \\n(e) Ensuring convenient Marshalling of wagons from  the operational efficiency point of view. \\n(f) Ensuring right time start to outgoing trains. \\n2. Economy: \\n \\n(a) Maximising productivity of resources and mi nimising the detention to Train Engine/Light \\nEngine, Shunting Engine, crew  and other connected staff. \\n(b) Optimising the Trailing load of the trains. \\n(c)\\n Optimising shunting engine utility. \\n3. Safety : \\n \\n(a) Ensuring minimum damage to wagons and consignments loaded on the wagons during the \\nshunting operations. ', metadata={'source': 'operating manual-traffic.pdf', 'page': 51}), Document(page_content='(b) Ensuring safe Marshalling and C&W pattern of examination. \\n(c) Elimination of Yard accidents. \\nii) Kinds of Yards:  \\nMarshalling Yard can be classified under three groups on the basis of the method of sorting out trains:- \\n1. Flat Yard:  Flat Yards are generally laid on flat or level land where shunting operations are \\ncarried out with the help of engine by push and pull method.  Such Yard is economical in \\nspace but slow in working and wasteful in shunting engine hours. \\n2. Hump Yard:   Hump Yards are constructed by providing gradients between reception and \\nthe sorting and despatch lines and the grids. T he gradients are created by constructing an \\nartificial hump suitable for the purpose. The gradient of the hump is constructed in such a \\nmanner that the wagons roll down of their own to specified sorting lines from the \\nsummit(apex) of the hump after having been pushed up by the shunting engine. The load \\nis pushed up by engine towards the hump from one side of the hump so that the uncoupled \\nportion of the load rolls away towards another side of the hump in sorting/despatch line. \\nThere are generally two humps one for ‘Down’ and one for ‘Up’ Yard.  These Yards are \\neconomical in shunting engine hours as compared to flat Yards. \\n3. Gravity Yard:  Gravity Yards are constructed where t he natural contour of land permits a \\nsuitable falling gradient stretched over a sufficient length.  The falling gradient makes it possible to use the Yard to the fullest extent in Marshalling wagons/trains thus minimising \\nthe use of engine power.  Therefore gravity Yards are more economical than flat Yards but \\nthe layout of it dependent on the availability of plenty of land with the required topography \\nwhich is seldom possible. \\niii) Some Terms Concerning Marshalling Yards and its Components:  \\n Some of the components of Marshalling Yards are explained below: \\n1. Reception Yard:  Reception Yard comprises of the lines on which the incoming trains are \\nreceived and stand clear of other running lines while waiting their turn to be dealt with. \\nIncoming trains may be composed of wagons which are to go through after changing of \\npower, Crew and Guard or of  wagons requiring sorting and Marshalling. Separate grids \\nmay be provided in the reception Yard one for through trains and another for terminating \\ntrains. Separate reception Yards may be provided for trains coming from different \\ndirections. The grids for through trains bye passes the hump. \\n2. Sorting Yards:  It is a Yard in which the trains are broken up on the different sorting lines for \\nvarious directions or specified destinations, as per Marshalling order so as to form them \\ninto trains and prepare them for correct Marshalling. \\n3. Marshalling Lines:  The lines in which sorted wagons  are separated first, if necessary, \\naccording to commodity, type of vehicle, Marshalling order, direction and secondly reformed into trains in special order to meet  the requirements of the section ahead or any \\nother special transportation requirement. \\n4. Departure Yard:  In which load can be held ready for departing trains. Separate departure \\nYards for trains for different directions are provided in large Marshalling Yard. \\n5. Shunting Neck:   It is a line in a Yard leading to sorting lines on which the actual shunting of \\nthe trains maybe done clear of any running lines. \\n6. Gathering lines:   It is a line on which the turn outs to other lines are arranged. \\n7. Transfer lines:  These lines are meant for transferring wagons, generally from up Yard to \\ndown Yard or vice versa, in case of  two separate Marshalling or hump Yards. \\n8. By pass or avoiding lines:   It is a line, which skirts the hump, and its object is to avoid \\nengine going over the hump. It joins the shunting neck at one end and the main hump line short of the king point at the other.  It is also used for vehicles, which cannot be passed \\nover the hump into the sorting Yard due to various reasons. \\n9. Engine Run Round Line:  It is the line reserved for movements of incoming and outgoing \\ntrain engines to and from the Yard or the loco shed, or for independent movement of \\nshunting engines. \\n10.\\n Engine Escape Line:   It is the line meant for engine movements to and from the loco shed \\nfrom and to Yard so that engine returning to loco sheds do not interfere with engines, going \\nout of the loco shed, or with any other movements in the Yard. \\n11. King Points:  The first pair of points a wagon meets with after passing over the hump are \\ncalled ‘King Points’. They divide the sorting Yard into two portions. ', metadata={'source': 'operating manual-traffic.pdf', 'page': 52}), Document(page_content='12. Queen Points:  The second pair of points a wagon m eets with on its way downwards are \\ncalled Queen Points, which further divide the sorting Yards into four portions. \\n13. Jack Points:   The third pair of points a wagon meets are called the jack points and these \\nserve to divert the rolling wagons into the different grids of the sorting Yard.  Points beyond \\njack points called ‘Ten points’. \\nNote :  In a hump Yard there are usually a pair of ‘king points’ two pair of ‘Queen points’ and four pairs of \\n‘Jack points’. \\n14. Retarders:   One of the main problems in the working of a hump Yard is to adjust suitably \\nthe speed of the humped wagons rolling down  so that they may not cause damage by \\nhumping down against wagons already standing on the same line. The speed of the \\nhumped wagons varies according to the force of the push given by the engine, the height \\nof the hump, the weight the nature of the axle  box (viz. roller bearing or plain bearing) as \\nalso on the weather prevailing. \\n In mechanised Yards, retarders or rail brak es are installed to reduce and keep the speed \\nof the humped vehicles under control. The retarders may be automatic or manually \\noperated. \\n15. Skids:  At Yards, where mechanical retarders are not provided skids are placed on the \\nsorting lines to control the speed of the humped wagons.  These skids are placed by skid porters and the skids automatically come out  of runways, where provided, or/and are \\nremoved after the wagon has come to stop. \\n16. Brake van siding:   In this siding, brakevans of incoming terminating trains etc. may be \\ndetached for subsequent attachment to originating trains. \\n17. Special stock siding:  These are provided for keeping for special type stock, cattle wagons \\ncontaining commodities like explosives which can not be humped. \\n18. Stabling Lines:  In large Yard, ballast, mate rial or POH special, empty military special trains \\nare sometimes required to be stabled.  Moreov er there are heavy accumulations of certain \\nclasses of stock for various reasons.  The stabling accommodation in the Yard should, \\ntherefore be ample so that the Yard may retain  its mobility inspite of any accumulation of \\nwagons or other set backs.  \\n19. Sick lines:   Normally sick wagons are sorted out in the sorting Yard, then sent in the sick \\nline. As the time taken in placing wagons into and withdrawing them from a sick line is \\nusually several times the time spent in actual repairs. Provisions should be made to carry \\nout whatever repairs are possible in the sorting Yard itself by providing sick lines. \\niv) Telecom Equipment of Marshalling Yards:  \\nA Marshalling Yard should necessarily have the best  possible telecom facility for proper functioning and \\nefficient supervision of work: \\n1. Telecommunication arrangement:  Since a Marshalling Yard covers a considerably big \\narea, the distance between its different points and portions becomes naturally long. Therefore extensive telecom network, through an electronic exchange and intercoms \\nbetween all-important points in the Yard, is imperative so that instructions to the \\nsupervisory staff can be conveyed quickly ov er telephone. The Yard should also have \\ndirect dialling trunk facilities and Control Telephones, so that instructions to the \\nsupervisory staff can be communicated properly and promptly. \\n2. Paging and talk-back arrangement:  Major Marshalling Yards are provided with Paging and \\ntalk-back sets, through which orders and instru ctions are issued to the staff concerned, \\nworking in different spheres in the Yard, from one central point. Similarly, the staff can also \\nconvey any information to the central points.  This helps co-ordination between different \\nspheres of the Yard. \\n3. Loud speakers are also provided at convenient points so that instru ctions can be conveyed \\nto different staff working in the same area. For example, loudspeakers are provided in the \\nSorting Yard, so that the incharge of the hum p can convey instructions relating to Hump \\ncabin and the skid Porters regarding the line on to which wagons are being shunted. \\nSimilarly, arrival and despatch of trains can be monitored. \\n4. Extensive use of good walkie-talkies will also go a long way in improving the efficiency of \\nthe Yards. \\nv) Yard Organisation:  ', metadata={'source': 'operating manual-traffic.pdf', 'page': 53}), Document(page_content='Yard working is controlled by a Chief Yard Master, though small Yards may be controlled by Yard Master. \\nBigger Yards may be under the control of Area Office r. The Yard in charge has two organisations under \\nhim. \\n1. Field staff:   It includes the Chief Yard Masters, wh o is overall Inchar ge of the Yard and \\nYard Masters in each shift are responsible for operat ional work. In dual yard system, there may be more \\nthan one Yard Masters, e.g. one for Down Yard and another for Up Yard, on the other hand, where the \\ntraffic is comparatively low, Yard Masters may be r eplaced by Assistant Yard Masters. The next level of \\nsupervision is generally related to the shunting engines. Each shunting engine may have an Assistant Yard \\nMaster/Shunting Master, attached to it, who contro ls the movements of the shunting engine. Shunting \\nJamadar may be included in the organisation to assist them for dealing with the shunting work allotted to \\neach engine. Where the shunting work is not heavy or  comparatively unimportant, the Shunting Jamadar \\nmay be incharge instead of Yard Master. Each shunting engine generally has a batch of three or four \\nPointsmen, whose duties are usually as under: \\n(a) For Uncoupling the wagons \\n(b) For Braking of wagons \\n(c) For Relaying of signals \\n(d) For operating the points. \\n The above staff from the organisation for sorti ng work besides other staff are also required for \\nvarious  auxiliary func tions – cabin staff, call boys, box boys (brake or skid porters in  hump Yards) etc. \\napart from the staff of other departments. \\n2. Trains Branch:  CTNC or Head TNC, has over all responsibility for the efficient working of \\nthe trains branch. Below them, there are Head TNCs/ Sr.TNCs/TNCs, who may be on shift duties or during \\nday duty only, depending on the work load of the Yard. These Trains Clerks are entrusted with \\ncomparatively important work in the trains branch  like preparation of Marshalling Yard statistics, \\nmaintenance of the Yard Balance Register, Daily Stock Taking etc. The TNCs in shift duties take stock of \\ntrains in Reception and Despatching Yard. They also maintain Wagon Exchange Registers, Phase-wise \\nDetention Register and stock on line position. The num ber of TNCs in a Yard will depend on the number of \\nwagons, trains dealt with in a Yard. \\n \\n3. Yard Working Instructions:  \\nFor proper and efficient working of each Yard, general directions for working in each shift should \\nbe laid down in the Yard Working instructions. The in structions should deal with all important aspects of \\nworking in detail other than the procedure for recepti on and despatch of trains, etc., which are required to \\nbe given in the Station Working Rules to be useful fo r the general guidance of staff working in the Yard as \\nwell as to the new and the relievi ng staff. The Yard Working instruct ions should be pr epared generally \\nunder the following heads:- \\na. Full description of the Yard including no. of lines with their holding capacity etc. \\nb. Strength of the Yard Staff in each shift. \\nc. Quantum of inward, outward and internal traffic required to be dealt with by the Yard and their \\ntimings. \\nd. Marshalling Orders in force. \\ne. Shunting engines available in each shift and their utilisation, generally. \\nf. Procedure of work to be carri ed out, generally in each shift. \\ng. Directions to Shunting Jamadars and Yard Mast ers on arrival on duty, in general, in regard to \\nadvance planning of the work during their shift. \\nh. Directions to Shunting Jamadars and Yard Masters in  regard to position of the Yard at the time \\nof handing over the charge. \\ni. Important Safety Precautions \\nj. Miscellaneous instructions. \\n \\n4. Main Works required to be performed by Yards:  \\nGenerally a large Yard is required to perform the following work with due regard to efficiency, reliability, \\neconomy and safety: \\na. To pass through trains after changing of engine and carriage examination and detaching \\nsick wagons, if any, and adjusting load of the train if necessary. \\nb. To break up and sort out terminating trains and loads and the local loads originating in the \\nYard. ', metadata={'source': 'operating manual-traffic.pdf', 'page': 54}), Document(page_content='c. To form originating through trains for the farthest point possible in accordance with long \\ndistance Marshalling orders laid down by the HQ office. \\nd. To form shunting and van trains for the different sections served by the Yard. \\ne. To hold back trains and wagons until they are able to go out. \\nf. To keep wagon detention to the minimum while planning item No. (1) to (5). \\ng. To move train engines and pilots between the Yard/Loco Shed and sidings. \\nh. Placement and removal of inward loaded wagon s for the goods depots, loco shed, private \\nsidings etc. served by the Marshalling Yard. \\ni. Placement and removal of wagons from the repacking shed to the Yard. \\nj. Placement and removal of Sick/Fit wagons from the sick lines. \\nk. Assessment of room by the nominated shunting trains for roadside stations. \\nl. Arrangements for supply of stock as per I ndent Register and ODR required by the road \\nside station in accordance with the orders received from the CTNL(Stock). \\nm. Weighment of wagons in certain nominated Yards as and when required. \\nn. Maintenance of the correct tally of  the daily output of the Yard. \\no. Maintenance of record of detentions to othe r kinds of stock such as local loaded, sick \\nwagons, empties and special stock etc. \\n5. Some Factors Affecting Working of the Yards : \\n \\na. Lack of proper advance planning and co-ordinat ion between the Control and  the Yards, \\nand want of proper co-opera tion between the Yard staff, loco shed staff and carriage and \\nwagon staff, affects Yard working adversely.  Fo r efficient Yard working it is necessary that \\nthe Yard staff must plan their work in advan ce in consultation with control and adjacent \\nYards, if necessary the different members of the Yard staff should extend co-operation in \\nthe efficient working of the Yard as a matter of team sprit. \\nb. Sometimes, while breaking up the terminating trains, local wagons are not properly \\ncollected in specified lines and they remain scattered in the sorting and Marshalling lines \\nor other parts of the Yards thereby causing undue delay in the Yard operations. Endeavour should always be made to collect these wagons in lines specified for the purpose. \\nc. Late or irregular removal of loads from local areas affecting timely placement of wagons in \\ntheir appropriate sidings is often a chronic cause of trouble in the working of the Yard. \\nTherefore endeavour must always be made to adhere to the schedules for placement and \\nremoval of wagons in the different areas of the Yard in accordance with Yard working \\ninstructions. \\nd. Empty stock should not be allowed to lie scattered all over the Yard.  As far as possible empties should be sorted out in the groups in which they are generally required to be \\nworked out, keeping as far as possible sp ecial type of stock s eparately from general \\nwagons. All empties stock so grouped preferabl y be kept separate in specified lines. \\ne. Sick wagons and wagons for adjustment of loads and transhipment of contents often lie \\nscattered through out the Yard thus hampering the Yard operations.  Even if the number of sick wagons exceeds the repair capacity, thes e must invariably be kept collected in the \\nspecified lines and sick lines placement and removal should be done strictly according to the schedule.  Wagons required adjustments of  loads and transhipment or contents must \\nalways be placed in the appropriate line and attended to with the least possible delay. Where adjustment of loads can possibly be done in the Yard itself, this must be resorted \\nto. \\nf. Any tendency on the part of shunting engine Loco pilots to waste time on loco \\nrequirements should be curbed. Shunting engine must not be allowed more than the specified time for loco requirements at fixed intervals. \\ng. Higher wagons balance in a Yard affects its mobility. It is therefore very necessary that \\nproper analysis of the highest wagon balanc e beyond which mobility of the Yard is \\nseriously affected, should be worked out an d proper co-ordination between the Yard \\nMaster, Assistant Station Master, Control and adjacent Yard should be maintained all the \\ntime. To prevent excessive inflow of wagons, which seriously affects mobility of the Yard, an eternal watch should be kept on the Yard Balance and steps taken to keep within the \\nworking capacity of the Yard. \\nh. Efficiency of the Yard shunting engine is one of  the most important factors on which the \\nworking of the Yard depends. Requirement of a better shunting engine or an additional shunting engine during the busy periods, may therefore be found necessary for better ', metadata={'source': 'operating manual-traffic.pdf', 'page': 55}), Document(page_content='working of a Yard. In big Yards, efficienc y and sufficiency of the Yard shunting engines \\nshould be periodically examined and if frequent engine trouble is reported, supervisors of \\nloco should be posted temporarily with them until the cause of the trouble is removed. \\ni. Yard lay out:   The shunting Jamadar and the Yard Master should carefully watch if any \\nparticular feature of the layout, such as wr ongly placed cross over, a short shunting neck \\nor isolation of two busy groups of lines is a re strictive factor in the efficient working of the \\nYard, and if any minor additions and alterations, such as providing an additional \\ncrossovers, positioning an existing cross-over correctly, lengthing of a particular line, etc. \\nare likely to improve the working of a Yard, necessary proposals should be forwarded to the DRM(O). \\nj. Sometimes delay in the release of the wagons by public and departmental consignees cause heavy accumulation of local wagons thus affecting the working of the Yard. Advance intimation given to rake handling parties on the telephone and the departmental \\nsupervisors in the local area about the number of wagons awaiting unloading would enable \\nthem to make necessary arrangements in time for releasing the wagons. \\nk. Sometimes identification of any particular traffic, which affects the mobility of the Yard, is \\nrequired so as to advice to control to restrict the inflow. \\nl. In case of heavy congestions requiring block back on the neighbouring sections, \\nneighbouring Yard should be called upon or directed by Sr.DOM/CTNL by taking upon \\nthem some of the sorting and Marshalling wo rk, the congested Yard would normally have \\ndone. If necessary a competent Officer or Inspector should sit in the Yard and a direct operation until the congestions is cleared. \\nm. In the event of an accident temporarily reduci ng working capacity, steps should be taken to \\nregulate the inflow of trains into the Yard for a day or two, or such a long period as may be \\nabsolutely necessary until the emergency is over and the Yard has regained its normal \\nworking capacity.  The work load on the Yard must be suitably reduced to avoid serious \\nrepercussions on the Yard itself and on the neighbouring sections.  Accidents should \\npreferably be attended to personally by officers, as far as possible so that re-railing/restoration and clearance work may be done in the best possible manner.  \\nn. Late start of trains from the Yard:   Whatever may be the cause of late start of trains from a  \\nYard, this apart from reducing available capacity of the section, in turn, affects the working \\nof the Yard itself by delaying subsequent formations of trains. \\no. Yard facilities:  Ordinarily a Yard should be adequate enough for its requirements of sorting, \\nhandling of local traffic, formation of trains and for holding back stock until it can go out on \\nthe sections or to various installations in t he local area. If shunting or train movements in \\none part interferes with similar movement in the other parts, or if simultaneous reception of \\ntrains from and despatch to different directions is not possible, or the Yard starting a train \\nfrom or carrying on shunting in one group of lines while a train is being received in the \\nother group, if prevented, it requires careful attention of Supervisors, Inspectors and \\nDivisional Officers for necessary remodelling. If frequent congestion takes place in a Yard \\nor a Yard show poor performance, the entire working should be thoroughly examined to determine the root cause of congestion. The causes of strained working may be a \\ngenerally increase in traffic, large increase of traffic from one or two sections or stations, \\nbad working of some installations served by the Yard, small or obsolete shunting engines or their inadequacy etc. all these call for suitable action. \\np. Sometimes want of proper working facilities, such as adequate lighting, communication between the different key-points in the Yard and  the Yard Master and the Assistant Station \\nMaster requiring a number of messenger to run about in the Yard for this purpose, affects \\nthe working of the Yard adversely.  \\n6. Some of the other factors affecting the Yard working:  \\n(a) Non-rectification of hump gradients. \\n(b) Hump shunting not useful enough for the loads which require pushing of loads. \\n(c) Under load running of outward trains. \\n(d) Trains received mismarshalled. \\n(e) Congestion/interruption on the section or  in the intermediate  or terminal \\nYards. \\n(f) \\nHeavy receipts of local wagons. \\n(g) Shortage of engines. \\n(h) Train Crew shortage. \\n(i) Heavy shortage of Yard work ing staff including C&W staff. ', metadata={'source': 'operating manual-traffic.pdf', 'page': 56}), Document(page_content='7. Operating Considerations Governing Design of a Yard: \\ni) The lay-out of the Yard should be such that as far as possible movements of wagons in \\ntheir several Marshalling operations would be continuous and progressive in the direction \\nof the destination of the wagon s because reverse or zig-zag movements reduce efficiency. \\nThe reception lines, sorting lines, shunti ng necks, Marshalling lines, departure lines \\nshould, wherever possible, be arranged with this object in view. \\nii) The layout should also satisfy the basic prin ciples of maximum flexibility in movements \\nconsistent with safety so that as many as  possible of the different types of movements \\nwhich are required to be performed may be carried out. At one and the same time it should \\nbe possible to perform all the different movements which are to take place at the same time. \\n The following independent movements within one and the same area should be planned \\nas far as possible. \\n(a) Simultaneous reception of trains from different directions. \\n(b) Simultaneous despatch of the trains to different directions. \\n(c) Two or more shunting engines worki ng, not to interference with one \\nanother, by provision of separate shunting necks. \\n(d) Reception of one train not to interfer e with the departure of another train \\nand vice-versa. \\n(e) Reception of trains in one part of the Yard should not interfere with \\nshunting in another part. \\n(f) In large Yards, there should be separ ate lines for Reception, Marshalling \\nand Despatch. Bye-Pass Running lines may be provided if possible, when only crew change is required. \\n(g) There must be adequate facility of li ght and communication in the different \\npart of Yard. Yard should be so designed as to permit future extensions in \\neach important section, like reception lines, sorting lines/ Marshalling \\ngroup etc. in the next 25 years though on consideration of economy, requirements of the next five years only may the first instance be provided. \\n9. Marshalling Yard Statistics: (Manual of Statistical Instructions Volume-I) \\n(Railway Board has decided that statistics s hall be maintained in terms of 8-wheeler units. \\nSame be incorporated by the railways) \\nGeneral Instructions: \\na. The Marshalling Yard statistics should be prepared for selected Yards generally dealing \\nwith 8000 eight-wheeler wagons and over per month in respect of BG Yards and 5000 \\neight wheeler wagons and over per month in re spect of MG Yards, prior approval of the \\nRailway Board should however, be obtained for addition or deletion of any Yard. \\nb. Brake vans are to be included. \\nc. The area of each Marshalling Yard is to be carefully defined and no extra allowance is to be made for any work done within that area.  A diagram showing the Marshalling Yard area \\nclearly demarcated should be prepared for the Yards for which statistics are requires to be \\ncompiled by the Railway for the Board.  This diagram should be readily available at the stations to enable any inspecting officer to obt ain a clear indication of the extent of the \\nMarshalling Yard. \\nd. Sick lines and repacking sheds, transhipment points, goods sheds, departmental sidings \\nand the industrial sidings etc., may as a general rule, be treated as lying outside \\nMarshalling Yards for purpose of calculation of Marshalling Yard statistics. \\ne. At places, where there are points like the G oods terminal station and/or Brake-of gauge \\ntranshipment point etc., continuous to the Ma rshalling Yard, and the detention statistics for \\neach of these Yards are compiled separately ei ther for submission to the Railway Board or \\nfor inclusion in the Railway’s own Domestic Statistics. The sum total of detention in each \\nYard should accord with the total detention from arrival of a wagon till its final despatch \\nfrom that station. To ensure this, the supervisory staff in-c harge should exercise a check, \\nat least once in a month, on a random sampling basis.  This check should be broad based \\ncovering not only the important categories of wagons e.g. four wheelers, BOX wagons, oil \\ntanks etc. but also the main stream of movement of wagons to and from different \\ndirections. This exercise should cover at least 10% of the total number of local wagons \\ndealt with in the Marshalling Yard during the previous month and the records of such checks should be properly maintained to be available for scrutiny by inspecting personnel. \\nf.

The shunting time within the Marshalling \\nYard area should only be taken into account and not the time spent outside its limits. \\n(b) Shunting engine hours are to be reckoned from th e time of arrival of the shunting engines \\nin the Marshalling Yard upto the time of their departure from the Yard on the basis of shunting vouchers. The time spent on locomotive duties whether in the Yard itself or \\noutside the Yard is to be included. However, any extra time taken over the normal time \\nprescribed for carrying out legitimate locomotive duties should be excluded, the normal \\ntime being determined by the individual railway taking into account the local conditions and \\nindicated in the operating manuals. \\n If shunting engine is required to be repaired in the Yard itself, the extra time beyond 30 \\nminutes spent on such repairs in a shift should also be excluded. \\n (c) The time spent in the Marshalling Yard for change of crew and/or fuelling, should be \\naccounted for in the same manner as on locomotive duties referred to in Note (1)(b) above. \\n(d) Since shunting engines shunt both coaching and goods vehicles, the allocation of shunting \\nengine hours to goods and coaching stock may be fixed for each Yard on a percentage basis after an examination of the work done.  This percentage is to be rechecked at least \\nonce a year and also when any change occurs in the type of traffic passing through that \\nYard.

It is es timated that for running a train over a section, co-\\noperation and co-ordination of about (2 000) thousand Railway staff is esse ntial. A vast organisation, such \\nas the Indian Railway system functions on the basis of a carefully arranged system of selective Autonomy, \\nAccountability and Responsibility.  Rules and instructi ons lay down the procedure of work and the staff are \\nproperly trained and the officials at various levels monito r, supervise and direct the staff from time to time \\nby different means. Inspection is an important function of management, particularly in the field of Railway \\nOperations to ensure efficient working at all levels. \\nFollowing objects shall be borne in mind while conducting inspection: \\n1. Verify whether every Railway employee is fully conv ersant with rules, inst ructions and procedures \\nrelating to his duties. 2. Ascertain that the staff is performing their duties according to rules, inst ructions and the procedure \\nin force. 3. Detect undesirable shortcuts, irregularities or unsafe  practices being resorted to by the staff taking \\nremedial action which may be:- \\n(a) Educative, in case these are resorted to out of ignorance. \\n(b) Corrective, if there is something wrong in the working conditions, or there are system \\ndeficiencies. \\n(c) Punitive, if resorted to wilfully or negligently and persisting   even after repeated guidance and counselling. \\n4. Observe the conditions actually prevailing at the work spots to understand the difficulties \\nexperienced by staff including their personal grievances and seeking on the spot redressal. \\n5. Ensure that full complement of staff and equipment is available and staff have knowledge of its \\noperation. 6. Ascertain that registers, docu ments and other records are being   maintained and preserved \\naccording to instructions. \\n7. monitor the behaviour of staff towards customer s, particularly promptness of response and \\nwillingness to help. 8. Assess as far as possible that the interest of the public and the Railways are kept in view and \\nsafeguarded. \\n9. Inculcate discipline and build up the morale of the workers. \\n10. Check the compliance of previous inspection reports. \\n11. Analyse efficiency targets vis-à-vis performance.  \\nInspections, thus provide the means to achieve efficiency and effectiveness through spot checks and \\npersonal contact with the staff on line. In order to accomplish these objectives, inspections have to be \\ncarried out at officer's and Supervisor's level. The inspecting official has to command the respect and \\nobedience of staff, for his inspection to be effectiv e and beneficial and as su ch his conduct should be \\nexemplary. \\nTypes of Inspections:  \\nThe following inspections have to be carried out by operating and safety officials:-   \\n \\nRegular Inspection (six monthly) -  \\nEach station on the division must be inspected in details  at least once in every six months i.e. January to \\nJune and July to December covering the various aspects of safety, operations and allied matters including \\nstaff matters. The inspection shall be carried out by the Sr.DOM/DOM/Sr.DSO/DSO/ AOM \\n/ARM/SS/SM/DTI/TI etc. While minor stations are in spected by the TI concerned, the DRM will nominate \\nimportant stations (including all such stations which do not fall within the jurisdiction of TI, that is those \\nwhich have SS/SM in grade equivalent to or higher than th ose of TI of the section)  to be inspected by the \\nnominate officers.  Each officers will be allotted at le ast two such a stations.  The officials concern shall \\nalso spend the night at the station.  Regular in spections have to be comprehensive in nature.  \\n   \\nSafety Inspections (monthly) – Safety inspections are basically meant to  be preventive by detecting short cut \\nmethods and unsafe practi ces resorted to by tr ain passing, running and  maintenance staff.  The \\nirregularities noticed must be personally brought to the notice of the Station Master and remedial measures \\ninitiated promptly.  In case of any serious irregularity, the inspecting officials must at once inform \\nSr.DSO/DSO or Sr.DOM/DOM concerned  personall y or telephonically beside making a written report.  \\n \", metadata={'source': 'operating manual-traffic.pdf', 'page': 72}), Document(page_content='Surprise Inspection (Monthly) \\n \\nSuch inspections must have an element of surprise.  Officers and Inspectors may inspect a station either \\nwhile passing through it or during the short time at their disposal or when they want to check some aspect at the station without prior notice.  Apart from any s pecial aspect, they intend to  check; they must also \\nobserve and take note of the irregul arities/ deficiencies or good work being done which may come to their \\nnotice.  They may check as many items as possible as time permits.  Minimum 6 such inspections in a \\nmonth shall be conducted by the sectional TI.   \\nIn the automatic signalling territory, besides surprise inspections, ambush checks should also be conducted to check whether the Loco pilots / Motormen are observing the rules regarding passing of \\nautomatic signal at ‘ON’ position etc. \\n Similarly loco pilots’ whistling at whistle boards on apporoach of LC gates also needs to be checked \\n Night Inspection (fortnightly) –  \\nNight inspection must be carried out by the Officers and Supervisors frequently to appreciate the working \\nconditions as well as to detect the irregularities. Surprise night inspection may be carried out between 00 hrs. to 4 hrs. because during this period, the staff \\nis likely to be lethargic and negligent in duties.  Si milarly, instances of staff sleeping on duty, dim signal \\nlamps and indicators, unauthorised absence from  duty and many other irregularities, unsafe and \\nundesirable practices may come to notice between 00 hrs. to 4 hrs.  Frequent night inspections are a must \\nand SS/SM must conduct surprise night inspections fort nightly of their station between 00 to 4 hrs. and \\ntake remedial measures to rectify t he irregularities and deficiencies noticed. \\n   \\nLevel Crossing Inspections –   \\nLevel crossing gates should be inspected in detail with  a view to ensure safety of rail and road traffic, \\navailability of safety equipments, knowledge of Gatemen regarding rules pertaining to his duties and loco \\npilot’s whistling while passing the LC gates. \\n \\nSurprise Inspection by Road – \\n \\nThese inspections have an element of surprise in them .  To create a sense of alertness amongst the staff \\nthe road inspection should be carried out without informing anybody. \\n \\nFootplate Inspections –  \\nFootplate Inspections are carried out  by travelling on the engine of running trains.  These afford an \\nopportunity to the inspecting official to observe and check certain aspect of working on the engine, along \\nthe track and at the stations which can not be check ed otherwise.   To achieve the purpose for which \\nfootplate inspections are carried out, it is essential that these are done by day and by night, in clear \\nweather and when the visibility is poor due to thick, foggy or tempestuous weather. \\n \\nJoint Footplate Inspections –   \\nThese are carried out jointly with officials of Me chanical, Electrical (Running), Permanent Way and \\nSignalling branches e.g checking the visibility of the signals, their locations, operations, lighting up, speed \\nrestrictions and caution boards rail wheel interaction and loco pilots’ and assistant loco pilots’ operating \\nbehaviour. \\n  \\nSurprise Speed checks – \\n In order to ensure the maximum permissible speed  are not exceeded, permanent and temporary speed \\nrestrictions are correctly observed and limits of  speed over turnouts and facing points are observed, \\nsurprise speed checks should be conducted as per schedule.  \\n \\nRunning Rooms Inspections –  \\nDuring regular, safety, surprise and night inspections opportunity should also be taken to inspect running \\nrooms to ensure that running staff are able to get proper food and resting facilities.  Running rooms should \\nalso be jointly inspected by the team of officers as nominated and prescribed. \\n   Ambush checks –   \\nIt is essential to ensure rigid observation of rules when automatic stop signals are passed in ‘ON’ position.  \\nThe inspecting officials should carry out ambush checks with the help of signalling officials who will arrange ', metadata={'source': 'operating manual-traffic.pdf', 'page': 73}), Document(page_content='to put an automatic stop signal to ‘ON’ position.

Before commencing the inspection all inspection books should be called for and the notes \\nmade by other inspecting official should be carefully  persued to check whether the staff have complied \\nwith their instructions.  If any of these instructi ons have not been carried out written explanation of the \\nStation Master should be obtained. \\n2. It shall not be enough merely to point out the irregularit y of the staff; matters must be put right \\npersonally while at the stati on to the extent possible. \\n3. All books and registers inspected must be initialled and dated. \\nTechnique of Inspections:  \\nIt requires both expertise and experience to carry out intelligent inspections. To evolve a sound \\ntechnique of inspections an inspecting official should: \\n1. Have a clear understanding of the station lay out its signalling, special features of working and \\nthe instructions in regard to rec eption, despatch, crossing, shunting and running through of trains.  For \\nthis he should have a good knowledge of not only G eneral & Subsidiary Rules but also of Station \\nWorking Rules. \\n2. Select the feature of working which he intends  to check during his inspection and should have \\na clear conception about them in his mind.  For instance he may like to emphasise on the correct \\nreception and despatch of trains and observance of safe ty rules by the staff or on utilisation of stock, \\ndetention to passenger or goods train, knowledge of staff etc. \\n3. Inspect the aspect of working by thorough inspection of books, registers, forms and \\nequipments used for operations and secondly by means of personal observation of actual operations. \\nBe selective in choosing:  \\n(a) The time and operations of personal observation. \\n(b) The documents, registers and fo rms for checks and cross checks. \\n(c) The equipments for checking, its availability, adequacy, maintenance and its use. \\n5. Select specific periods for checking registers books and forms keeping in view the purpose of \\ninspection and time of inspections and time of di sposal, should be subjected to concentrated, minute \\nand probing checks and cross checks.  It may be worth wh ile to select two or more separate periods.  \\nOne of these being that immediately preceding the day of inspection.  This will help him in not only \\ndetecting the irregularities being committed but also whether these have been continuing for the past \\nsome time. \\n6. Discuss the irregularities or lapses noticed during inspection with the staff actually doing the \\nwork as well as those supervising their work.  Such a discussion will prove to be educative and \\nproduce useful results. \\n7.

Basic Principles: -  The basic principles of interlocking are as follows: - \\n \\nv) It shall not be possible to take “off” conflicting signals at one and the same time. \\n \\nvi) It shall be possible to take “off” signal for a running line only when:- \\n \\n(a)  All points on the running line are correctly set and facing points locked  \\n \\n(b)  All points, giving access to the running line from the sidings and goods lines, \\nare set against the running line. \\n \\n(c)  Level crossing gates if included or controlled by interlocking are closed and \\nlocked against the road traffic. \\n \\n(d)  A signal lever when operated must lock or back lock as necessary the levers \\noperating the points and gate locks referred to above. \\n \\n Once signal is taken off it shall not be possible to alter the points, to unlock \\nthe gate lever etc until all signals are taken off have been put back. \\n \\nvii) When all signals are in the “On” position, all points which would be locked by taking ‘off’ such signals must be free fo r shunting purposes/testing etc. \\n  \\niv) It must be impossible to take “off” a Warner Signal, until all the \\nrelevant  stop signals in \\nadvance have first been taken “off” and when “off” it must back lock all such signals.  \\n \\na) Interlocking –  \\n \\nPoints, Signals and other units are usually, operated by means of levers and panels. \\nInterlocking between these levers is accomplished either by mechanical or by electrical or electro-mechanical or electronic means.  In the former method, some mechanical contrivance \\nvariously designed, controls the relation between one lever and the other. \\n \\nAt less important stations the point, signal and ot her levers are interlocked by means of keys \\nwhich are used to lock or release the levers, either in the normal or in the reverse position, as \\nrequired.  At other stations t he levers are interlocked by means of tappets inside a box of the \\nlever frame, which is normally kept covered and sealed. \\n 3. Types of Interlocking: \\n \\ni) Mechanical Interlocking. \\nii) Panel Interlocking (Relay) \\niii) Route Relay Interlocking. \\niv) Solid State Interlocking. \\n i) Mechanical Interlocking: \\n \\nThe era of interlocking started with mechanical frames.  In mechanical signaling, since the \\nfunctions are operated by levers, the relationshi p that should exist between the functions can \\nbe transferred to exist between the levers.  To ensure that the signal can be taken ‘OFF’ only \\nafter the point is correctly set, we can arrange the interlocking between the signal lever and \\npoint lever to be such that the signal lever can be reversed only after the point lever is in the \\ncorrect position, viz. ‘Normal’ or ‘Reverse’, as the case may be. \\n \\n           As the size of yards & train movements increased, size of lever frames also increased.  These lever frames not only increased in size occupying more space but also required \\nintensive maintenance. ', metadata={'source': 'operating manual-traffic.pdf', 'page': 79}), Document(page_content='  \\nii) Panel Interlocking: \\n \\n  With the advent of Electro-mechanical relays, lever frames gave way to relay \\ninterlocking based installations.  This development resulted in relatively faster operation, fail-\\nsafe operation and reduced size of buildings requi red for housing of interlocking installations.  \\nWith further increase in traffic and expansi on of railway network, panel Interlocking \\ninstallations were commissioned. \\niii) Route Relay Interlocking: \\n \\n Route Relay interlocking is same as Panel Interlocking with Electro Mechanical \\nRelays doing the Interlocking except that it can be employed for big yards.  the interlocking is done between one route and another route.  A nother Important feature in terms of operating \\npoint of view is that the SM has to only  press two buttons, Signal button & Route Button \\n(entry-exit system).  He doesn’t have to indivi dually operate the points to the required position. \\n \\niv) Solid State Interlocking (SSI): \\n \\n Computer based interlocking uses thousands of Electro-mechanical relays requiring \\ncomplex wiring and Inter-connections.  The wiring diagrams for such installations run into \\nhundreds of sheets.  Individual relays, wiring and interconnections along with thousands of \\nshouldered joints are required to be physically examined and certified.  This exercise requires \\ntraffic blocks of long durations and large manpower to manage the traffic during blocks.  \\n  Even for small yard re-modelling like addition of a loop line, all the above activities \\nare required to be redone.  Therefore, the advan tages of relay based interlocking installations \\nare being nullified. \\n \\n  The SSI system occupies considerably less space, consumes less power, is more \\nreliable and is easy to install and maintain. Also, initial commissioning & changes due to yard \\nre-modeling can be carried out in negligible time requiring skeleton manpower for traffic \\nmanagement during the blocks. \\n  Unlike PI or RRI, Microprocessors (IC’S) are doing the Interlocking based on pre determined \\nlogic circuits. \\n Advantages of SSI:-  \\n• Increase in section capacity. \\n• Faster operation. \\n• User friendly operation. \\n• Fail safe technique \\n• Multiple mode operation. \\n \\nSignificance of SSI for operating staff: \\n \\n• Reduces man power \\n• Centralised operation \\n• Multiple mode of operation \\n• Control cum indication panel \\n• Video display unit (P.C) \\n• CTC (Centralised Traffic Control)—permits remote control \\n• Significant reduction in traffic block time \\n• Easier & simple operation \\n \\n \\nIndirect and Direct Interlocking: -   \\n ', metadata={'source': 'operating manual-traffic.pdf', 'page': 80}), Document(page_content=' (a) Indirect interlocking means that the point s are set and locked from one place and the \\nsignals are operated from another place and another lever frame; the interlocking is \\neffected by means of keys carried from one place to the other. \\n \\n(b) Direct interlocking means that all levers, vi z. the point, the point locks and the signal \\nlevers are concentrated in one lever frame and worked therefrom; the interlocking is \\neffected by means of rigid connections between levers without the use of keys. \\n Standards of Signaling and Interlocking: - Interlocking at stations is st andardized into four different \\nclasses viz. I(R), II(R) ,III(III) and IV(R). The regul ations prescribing the four standards have been \\ndrawn up primarily to meet the needs of cros sing stations on the single line but, with such \\nmodifications as may be necessary in regard to th e equipment of signals; these are also applicable to \\nother stations both on single and double li nes.

The group to which the lever connected to the first approach signal, or Warner signal, situated to \\nthe left, or the person working the levers, belongs is al lotted the first set of consecutive levers, lying to \\nthe left of the frame.  The second set of consecutive le vers is allotted to group (iii), and the third set of \\nlevers lying to the right is allotted to the remaini ng group.

(Switch & Lock Movement):- When the \\nfacing points and the facing point lock are worked by the same lever, it is called \\n“Economical Point Lock” or “S.L.M.” \\n \\n(vii)  FACING POINT LOCK:-  It is a plunger bolt provided at facing points, which ensures \\nthat the points are correctly set and lo cked to prevent them from being moved. \\n \\n(viii)  FACING POINT LOCK BAR: - It is a bar prov ided at facing points is connected with a \\nfacing point lock, which prevents facing point lock being moved while a vehicle is passing or standing over it. \\n \\n(ix)  FOULING BAR:-  It is a bar provided at the fouling points between two diverging roads which prevents points being set and locked and signal being taken ‘OFF’ for \\none road while a train is standing short of clearance on the other road. \\n \\n(x)  LOCKING: -   A lever is said to be locked when in the normal position it cannot be \\npulled over.  A lever is said to be locking another lever when owing to the farmer’s remaining or in the normal or reverse position the latter cannot be pulled over. \\n \\n(xi)  RELEASE: - A lever releases another lever, when due to its operation the later can be \\npulled.  If lever No. 2 can only be pulled over when lever No. 1 is pulled then lever No. \\n1 is said to be de-releasing lever No. 2. \\n \\n(xii)  SLOT: - It is an electrical or mechanical arrangement where by a signal can only be \\nlowered only by the joint operation by two or more persons, but can be put back to \\n‘ON’ by any one of them. \\n \\n(xiii)  TONGUE RAILS: - These are rails with tapered movable ends which controls the \\nsetting of the route. \\n (b)  PANEL BUTTONS:  \\n1.

Responsibility of the Of ficers signing the SWRs : \\ni) SWRs are the functional rules governing the working of stations,. These need to be \\nprepared with care and attention as any deficiency in these rules can endanger safety \\n,in which case  the officers signing the SWRs shall alsol be held responsible along with other staff for breach of safety rules. \\nii) It is obligatory that the rule diagram of t he ground conditions are compared at site to \\nconfirm accuracy of R.D.  In absence of officials signing the SWR having verified it \\npersonally, the Transportation Inspector and the SE (Signal) will, after having jointly \\ninspected the site shall certify in writing t hat the actual layout conforms to what is \\nshown in the Rule Diagram and the number of points and signals quoted therein are \\ncorrect. \\n6. Reviewing of SWRs : \\n The SWRs should be reviewed once in every \\nfive years . In case the review brings out the \\nnecessity of carrying out changes, the SWRs  should be re-issued.  In the event of more than three \\ncorrection slips  having to be issued, the SWRs should be reissued without waiting for the periodical \\nreview to be conducted every five years as mentioned above. \\n7. Method of correcting SWRs:  \\n Whenever any addition/amendment is required to be made in the said rules, the entire \\npage/pages duly signed by concerned officers on which the provisions requiring addition/amendment \\nappears should be replaced.

', metadata={'source': 'operating manual-traffic.pdf', 'page': 97}), Document(page_content=' NON – INTERLOCKED WORKING OF STATION  (Back to Index)  \\n \\nNon Interlocking \\n \\ni) N.I. Working means temporary di sconnection of points, signals, track circuits, axle counters \\nand other signaling gadgets for any designated works.  This kind of working is normally \\nresorted to works such as over hauling of lever frames, yard remodeling, introduction of \\npanel/RRI working, cable etc., \\n \\nii) In another sense, at an interlocked station when points and signals become defective, station \\nbecomes non-interlocked for the purpose of working.  \\n \\nIn both the cases the safeguards ingrained through  normal functioning of various signaling equipment \\nare missing and as such responsibili ty of the part of staff increases manifold.  N.I. working puts staff \\nunder severe strain and hence prone for lapses.  Unflagging attention from every quarter is the need \\nof the hour so that safety is ensured. \\n \\nNon – Interlocked working entails not only slowing down of train operations; it is also a less safe \\nsystem as compared to interlock ed working. Since it is desirable to avoid NI altogether, both from \\nsafety as also customer convenience poin t of view, attempt must be made at the project proposal \\nstage itself  to dispense with NI altogether and undertak e the work by means of traffic blocks. \\n \\nInstructions given below are in addition to existing rules for Non – Interlocked working such as \\nissue of Green Notice etc. They must be read together with existing provisions in G&SR, Block \\nWorking Manual etc. \\n \\nA.  Requirement of Non – Interlocked Working:  \\nThe following guidelines are laid down for a correct assessment of whether NI working is required in \\nthe first place or whether it can be dispensed with altogether. \\n \\na. NI working should not be resorted to as far as possible, in case of installation of new S&T \\ngears. NI is unavoidable only if\\n modifications  are to be made to existing S&T gears . \\nb. For new S&T gears, there is no need of NI and the work can be managed through well-\\nplanned pre-change over works (insertions of point & crossing etc). The final change over \\nto new gears can be carried out under partial or complete traffic block. \\nc. At the project proposal stage itself, S&T dep artment should make it clear whether the \\nproject requires NI or not; and if it does, the duration of such NI. This fact must be \\nmentioned in the check list on the original tracing itself. \\nd. Sr. DOM & Sr. DCM must quantify the actual im pact of such NI, and deduce it to monetary \\nterms, by calculating anticipated losses both on  account of passenger and freight traffic. \\nThese should include losses on account of canc ellation, short termination, diversion, \\nrescheduling, detention to trains and imposit ion of restriction on booking/movement of \\nfreight traffic. \\ne. Expenses likely to be incurred on account of TA/DA of te mporary NI staff, and other \\nadministrative costs should also be added to a rrive at the traffic cost of proposed NI \\nworking. \\nf. This traffic cost of NI should be communicat ed to S&T, who will evaluate if new gears can \\nbe installed without resorting to NI for less than the expected cost of proposed NI, if \\nnecessary by constructing a new building etc. as the case may be.  \\ng. If new gears can be installed in a new building and commissioned under traffic block at a \\ncost that is comparatively less than the overa ll traffic cost of proposed NI, then the project \\nshould be recorded as one to be taken up without NI. \\nh. This entire exercise must be carried out unde r the personal supervision of DRM, who will \\nensure that all estimates are reasonable and no figures are unrealistic both with regard to duration of NI or the anticipated traffic cost. \\ni. Thus, NI will be undertaken only if found to be unavoidable, and this fact will be recorded \\non the original tracing, to be signed by branch officers concerned, and the DRM. \\n  \\n \\n Minor and Major Works : ', metadata={'source': 'operating manual-traffic.pdf', 'page': 98}), Document(page_content='  \\n1. Guidelines given below should be followed for deciding whether NI working is required or not. \\nNI working is not  required and the work can be managed by traffic block in following cases : \\n(i) Replacement of Mechanical lever frame by another Mechanical lever frame. \\n(ii) Replacement of Mechanical lever frame by panel. \\n(iii) Replacement of Panel by RRI. \\n(iv) Replacement of RRI by RRI. \\n(v) Commissioning of new SSI/RRI. \\n(vi) Amalgamation of newly constructed double line portion into existing conventional \\ndouble line. \\n2. NI working is required only for following cases : (i) Overhauling of cabins. \\n(ii) Replacement of Panel by Panel at road side stations. \\n(iii) Meggering of cables. \\n(iv) Changes in yard layouts \\n3. NI working can be divided into 2 distinct categories, namely minor and major works. \\n(i) Minor works – Overhauling of cabins at road side stations. \\n(ii) Major works – Changes in yard layouts, over hauling of cabins etc. at comparatively \\nbigger terminals and junction stations. \\nMINOR WORKS \\n(A) Procedure to be followed for Non – Interlocked Working for Minor Works  : \\nRoad side stations on double line having up to 2 lines in each direction, and on single line \\nhaving up to one main line and 2 loop lines are covered under this heading of Minor Works. \\n(C1) Duration of NI working for Minor Works  : \\n1. A road side station would normally have about 21 lever in each end cabin (including spare levers). \\n2. S&T department must suitably augment the strength of their NI gang so that each cabin can \\nbe completed in one day. \\n3. NI working at the 1\\nst cabin should start at 8/- hrs. in the morning and by 18/- hrs. the same \\nmust be interlocked and handed back to traffic. \\n4. The same procedure should be repeated the next day for the 2nd cabin. \\n(C2) General Instructions for Train Operation  : \\n1. Speed restriction of 15 kmph. shall be imposed over all facing points. \\n2. No train/wagon should be stabled on an y running line of the NI station. \\n3. The common line should not be used for reception of trains coming from opposite directions. \\n4. Emergency and other crossovers including sidings taking off from the station should be set for \\nnormal position and clamped and padlocked. The keys of all padlocked points must be kept in \\nthe personal custody of the overall in-charge of NI working to prevent their being used even by \\nmistake. \\n(C3) Train Running on double line section during NI working  : \\n1. Twin single line should be suspended during the duration of NI working and section worked as \\nconventional double line only. \\n2. No temporary single line working should be introduc ed during NI period, except in case of an \\naccident or blockade of through communication. \\n3. At road side stations on double line, route must  be set for platform line in each direction and \\nclamped and padlocked. \\n4. In case there is more than one platform in each  direction, route must be set for one nominated \\nplatform. \\n5. At all such stations no precedence should be arranged. \\n6. During the NI period station should ba sically function as a halt station. \\n(C4) Train Running on single line section during NI working  : \\n1. Ideally, if possible, only one platform line should be nominated for train running. \\n2. The route must be set for this platform line in each direction and clamped and padlocked. \\n3. No precedence or crossing should  be arranged at this station. \\n4. In case it is not possible to nominate only one line, then 2 specific lines should be nominated \\nfor Up and Down movement. \\n5. In that case, while crossings would have to take place, no precedence should be arranged at \\nthis station. \\n(C5) Staff requirement  : \\n1. Sectional TI and SI will be overall in-c harge of NI working at the station. \\n2. Additional staff if required should be managed locally . \\nMAJOR WORKS ', metadata={'source': 'operating manual-traffic.pdf', 'page': 99}), Document(page_content=' (B) Procedure to be followed for Non – Interlocked Working for Major Works  : \\nChanges in yard layouts, overhauling of cabins  etc. at comparatively bigger terminals and \\njunction stations are covered under this heading of Major Works. \\n(D1) Duration of Non Interlocked Working  : \\n1. NI working must not be simultaneously introduced at more than one station in a Division. \\n2. NI must be planned during temperate weather, to  avoid wrong actions on account of harsh \\nand inclement weather. \\n3. Period of Non – interlocked working must be kept to the bare minimum as it is a potential \\nsafety hazard. \\n4. Staff of all departments must work round the clock in three shifts so that the work can be \\ncompleted at the earliest. \\n5. For NI working of up to 3 days, plans will be finalized in consultation with DRM, Branch \\nOfficers and concerned HOD of Construction/RE Organization. \\n6. For NI working of more than 3 days, plans will be finalized in consultation with CTPM, CPTM and HOD of RE/Construction Or ganization at Zonal level to assess the duration and \\narrangements of NI working.  \\n7. For more than 3 days NI, plans should be worked out for cancellation, diversion, rescheduling, short termination or even extension of trains as the case may be. \\n8. For NI working of more than 7 days persona l approval of the General Manager must be \\nobtained. \\n9. No NI working should last for more than 14 days. \\n(D2) Sanctions, clearances and preparatory works\\n : \\n1. Signal Plan must be finalised in Hdqrts. at least 45 days in advance. \\n2. All plans and clearances including CRS sanctions that are required for NI working must be \\navailable at least 1 month before commencement of NI working. \\n3. Under no circumstances should this  period of 1 month be relaxed. \\n4. NI working must be postponed in order to provide for 1 clear month before start of NI either in \\ncase of : \\n(i) Delay in receipt of above clearances/sanctions etc. \\n(ii) Last minute modifications to Signal Plan. \\n5. All pre – NI work that can be carried out wit hout non – interlocking must be completed before \\nactual NI working begins. These include changes in yard layout, insertion /removal of points & \\ncrossings etc. Changing/installation of new  point machines must be done in advance. \\n6. Preparatory work in connection with OHE work  must also be done in advance, including \\nshifting of neutral section, if required. \\n7. Lessons learnt during previous NIs must be gone through in detail so that shortcomings of \\nearlier occasions are avoided.  \\n(D3) Level of Supervision/Responsibility  : \\n1. Responsibility to ensure ava ilability of proper arrangemen t for NI working shall be of \\nConstruction/RE organization. \\n2. Though the responsibility to provide necessa ry arrangement will be of Construction/RE \\norganization, concerned branch officers from open line shall be responsible to ensure its \\navailability and functioning during train operation. For this he shall be the coordinating officer \\nfor the department concerned. \\n3. PERT chart should be made out detailing various activities to be completed on a day-to-day \\nbasis. \\n4. For round the clock working PERT chart should be made out detailing various activities to be completed on a shift to shift basis. \\n5. Dy. CSTE/Dy. CE/Dy. CEE as applicable shall make themselves available in non-interlocked \\narea where the work is being undertaken. \\n6. The concerned Project in – charge (XEN, DSTE/C on. etc) shall camp near the non-interlocked \\narea till completion of non-interlocked working. \\n7. Overall in charge for NI working will be Sr. DOM/DOM as the case may be for both Safety and \\nOperations. \\n(D4) Green Notice\\n : \\n1. Construction officials responsible for carrying out the work should send a ‘circular notice’ to \\nthe Sr. DOM/Sr. DSO at leas t two months in advance. \\n2. They will advise as to when the work will be undertaken with a request to issue special \\ninstructions. A copy of the notice shall also to be sent to SS of the station concerned.  \\n3. Sr. DOM/Sr. DSO on receiving such ‘circular notice’ get special instructions prepared for that \\nstation. These are then issued to all concerned. \\n4. Green notice is to be issued by Sr. DOM. It should incorporate the following : \\n(i) Details of existing yard layout and its various provisions. \\n(ii) List of all works to be completed by Ci vil Engg./S&T/Elec. before start of NI.  ', metadata={'source': 'operating manual-traffic.pdf', 'page': 100}), Document(page_content=' (iii) List of all works to be undertaken by Civil Engg./S&T/Elec. during NI period. \\n(iv) Additional facilities to be made available after commissioning of new works. \\n(v) Existing facilities that are to be dismantled. \\n(vi) Details of yard layout to be made available after completion of NI. \\n5. Signalling Plan must indicate permissible routings and simultaneous movement facilities to be \\nmade available. \\n6. Signalling Plan must invariably indicate whether any of existing facilities for train movement are to be (i) either curtailed, (ii) modified or (iii) restricted. \\n \\n(D5) Time Tabling changes\\n : \\nFor assessing the impact of NI working at a bigger  terminal or at a Junction station, a detailed \\nexercise has to be undertaken as indicated below. \\n1. During the course of NI working changing of points manually after passage of a train and after \\ncompleting all formalities takes about 10 minutes time. \\n2. The capacity of the junction station to handle maximum number of trains during a particular \\ntime period has to be worked out keeping in mind the above constraints. \\n3. Every possible train movement of recept ion and despatch must be clearly documented,  \\n(i) Along with time of movement. \\n(ii) With exact sequence of points, whether in normal or reverse. \\n4. For time-tabled moves, trains demanding same point  either at the same time or within 10 \\nminutes must be identified since this is the time required before an existing setting of points \\ncan be changed. In case of conflicting moves, t he less important moves have to be cancelled, \\nrescheduled or diverted.  \\n5. Crossing and precedence must be restricted to the bare minimum with few specific routes \\nbeing selected for most movements. \\n6. As a thumb rule, only 80% of the reduced c apacity as worked out should be utilized since \\nunforeseen failures such as ACP, equipment failures etc. are likely to take up the remaining \\n20% of the available capacity. \\n7. In all such planning it is better to keep adequate cushion in train operations and initially \\ncancel, reschedule or divert more number of trains than what may be required. In case NI \\nworking progresses smoothly without major detentions  and it is felt that some of the cancelled \\ntrains can be restored, the same may be done after a week or so. \\n8. Clear corridor for freight must be charted out, with exact number of moves possible, and extra \\nfreight trains that cannot be handled should be planned to be diverted to other routes. In case diversion is not possible then operating restrictions must be imposed. \\n9. More time must be spent in precise planning of  each move during NI period, such that the \\nstation is not brought under pressure at any time. \\n10. Changes in PRS reservation system for cancella tion, diversion, rescheduling etc. must be \\ndone in advance as per advance period of reservation. \\n(D6) Advance preparation for Train Running\\n : \\nStoppages on Platform  : \\n1. Duration of stoppages of Mail/Express trains  must be reduced to the extent feasible. \\n2. Loading/unloading of parcels should be reduced to the bare minimum. If possible handling of \\nparcels should be suspended giving due publicity in the Press and other media. \\n3. Running of trains with single SLR must be prohibited. \\n4. Shunting operations must be restricted to the bare minimum and preferably avoided \\naltogether as far as possible. \\n5. Booking of through carriages, inspection carriages, etc. to the NI stati on must be restricted. \\n6. Quick watering of coaches must be ensured by deputing additional staff as required. \\n7. Nominated stations for watering of coaches may also be changed if alternate stations are \\navailable. \\n8. Extra TXR staff on platforms for attending to defects in rolling stock and promptly attending to complaints. \\n9. Extra train lighting staff must also be deputed on platform duty for promptly attending to \\ncomplaints. \\n10. Special squads of commercial and RPF staff must be deputed on platform duty for checking \\nACP etc. \\n11. All efforts must be made to minimize detentions. \\n Crew Changing\\n : \\n1. Loco Supervisor must be kept on round the clock duty on the platform for quick change over \\nof crews. \\n2. If possible crew changing for through passing trains may be planned at adjoining stations. \\n3. If necessary, LIs may be deputed to accompany the loco pilot from one station before NI \\nstation till one station after NI station. ', metadata={'source': 'operating manual-traffic.pdf', 'page': 101}), Document(page_content=' 4. Traffic Supervisor must be kept on round the cl ock duty on the platform for quick change over \\nof guards. \\n5. At notice stations, computerized print out of caution orders must be used for saving time. \\n6. Similarly, extra porters should be deputed for de livering these caution orders to loco pilot and \\nguard. \\nLocomotives  : \\n1. Engine changing for through trains must be curtailed. \\n2. Locomotives must be freely extendable beyond territorial jurisdiction. \\n3. If it is unavoidable, then changing of locos ma y be done at either side of NI station. \\n4. For avoiding changing of locos from Diesel to El ectric and vice versa, train routings may be \\nchanged during the duration of NI working. \\n5. For traction changing, half shunt of locos may be freely resorted to. \\n6. Attaching of locos in rear should be resorted to in case of stations where trains reverse. \\n7. Sending of light engines to sheds must be rest ricted. For this purpose, an out pit may be \\nopened, if necessary. \\nControlling of Trains  : \\n1. In case of major terminal stations, a mini contro l office may be opened at the station. This mini \\ncontrol will liasion with divisional control office  for purposes of train running. The jurisdiction of \\nthis mini control office would be the NI stati on itself, and 2 – 3 stations on either side in each \\ndirection. \\n2. Station under going NI must not be permitted to be brought under any pressure whatsoever at \\nany time during NI working. \\n3. All relevant notices must be issued in advance. \\n(D7) Goomty Arrangements  : \\nLocation and number of goomties is an extremely important aspect of advance planning for \\nNI. Sr. DOM/Sr. DSO should personally appro ve final arrangements regarding goomties. \\n1. Cabins should not be used as goomties . \\n2. For a group of maximum  of three sets of points operated from the ground, one goomty should \\nbe made. \\n3. Ideally, only 2 sets of points should be controlled from a single goomty. \\n4. Each goomty should be provided close to the group of points that it controls. This will ensure \\nthat physical movement of staff is reduced to the bare minimum. \\n5. A group of 3 – 4 goomties at one end of the yard should be put in one zone. \\n6. Under no circumstances should 2 ends of the same points/crossings be with different \\ngoomties . This must be specially ensured for diamonds with single slips and also with double \\nslips. Each such diamond must be under the same zonal in-charge. \\n7. Location of each goomty as also number of points that are controlled from it should be \\ntentatively marked out in yard diagram. This should then be physically cross checked at site \\nby visiting the station yard. \\n8. At site it must be ensured that staff are not required to walk long distances for setting of \\npoints. \\n9. Both ends of each point must be clearly visible from the goomty itself. \\n10. A goomty must be provided near the first stop si gnal for prompt issue of OPT forms etc. as \\nrequired. Another goomty must be provided at t he last stop signal to ensure correct dispatch \\nof trains. \\n(D8) Staff Arrangements  : \\nStaff Requirement  : \\n1. Each goomty should have one ASM and two Po intsman in each shift. These extra ASMs \\nposted in goomties shall be called goomty ASMs. ASM posted with indoor ASM will be termed \\nas co-ordinating ASM. \\n2. For cabin operated points, extra commensurate staff as required (ASM/cabinman/ pointsman) \\nshould be provided. However, cabins should not be used as goomties as far as possible. \\n3. Goomty ASMs during their duty hours shall be fully in-charge of working of points/levers under \\ntheir charge. They shall disc harge all obligations of the c abinman/pointsman working at the \\nstation/cabin. They shall work under the di rect supervision and instructions of the co-\\nordinating ASM on duty. \\n4. A group of four goomties or more at each end of the station should be put in one zone. Each \\nzone should be under the charge of a TI in each shift. TI will periodically keep moving about \\namongst the goomties within his zone. He will check up and monitor the working of group of goomties under his charge. \\n5. For non-interlocking work at major terminal  stations, necessary arrangement for additional \\nstaff should be made, if necessary, from adjoining divisions, before undertaking NI working. \\n6. Under no circumstances should NI working be st arted unless full complement of staff is \\navailable at the station as per above norm and adequate training has been imparted to them. ', metadata={'source': 'operating manual-traffic.pdf', 'page': 102}), Document(page_content=' 7. Preferably those staff should be drawn from outstation who have  \\n(i) Adequate knowledge of NI working. \\n(ii) Previous experience of the same. \\n8. Boarding and lodging of outstation staff is an impor tant aspect of NI preparation. Dormitory \\ntype arrangement would be ideal, if these can be arranged. At major junctions these can be \\ntaken care of by stabling a few coaches at sidings. However, facilities will have to be arranged \\nfor electrical charging, watering, cleaning of bathrooms, sanitation etc. \\n9. On divisions where separate non – interlocking gangs are already in existence their strength may be adjusted accordingly. However, composit ion of such NI gangs should be periodically \\nchanged by inducting fresh faces and with drawing earlier ones. \\n10. Round the clock engineering gangs with crow-bar s and handles should be available to move \\npoints in emergency. One gangman should be available with each goomty in each shift for this purpose. \\n11. At each non-interlocked station one Asst. Scal e officer of operating department will be \\nnominated for over all supervision. \\n(D9) HOER\\n : \\n1. Under no circumstances HOER violation should be permitted during NI working. As far as \\npossible duty hours of staff should  be restricted to 8 hrs. duty per shift in continuous roster. \\n2. For catering to unexpected casualties such as leave, sickness etc. during the NI period, RG \\nand LR staff must invariably be provided for.  \\n3. RG and LR must be made available shift wise. The standard of RG and LR should be the same as that of regular duty cadre staff for that shift as stipulated. \\n(D10) Duty Rosters shift wise\\n : \\nMeticulous detailed planning must be carried out for drawing up roster of staff to be deputed \\nfor NI working. While drawing up roster of sta ff for various shift duties, following guidelines \\nmust be followed : \\n1. Duty rosters must be drawn up as per guidelines given below. \\n2. These should be drawn up for the entire duration of NI period. \\n3. Duty rosters drawn up should be openly displayed and given wide publicity. \\n4. No staff shall be permitted to mu tually exchange his duty roster  with any other staff, without \\nprior permission of his departmental officer at site. \\n5. Level ‘N + 1’ shall be responsible for ensuring that level ‘N’ has followed all instructions, etc. \\nas laid down above. \\nLast Night Shift Duty  : \\n1. Regular staff permanently posted at the NI stati on must be rostered duri ng the last night shift. \\n2. Second preference should be for staff who ha ve previously worked at that station. \\n3. Best and most competent supervisors shoul d be deployed for last night shift duty. \\n First Night Shift Duty  : \\n1. Regular staff permanently posted at the NI st ation, if still available for deployment after \\ncovering last night shift, should be rostered for first night shift duty. \\n2. Second preference should be for staff who ha ve previously worked at that station. \\n3. Amongst outstation staff preference should be as follows : (i) Senior staff having previous experience of NI working. \\n(ii) Staff who are presently posted at major junctions. \\n Day Shift Duty\\n : \\n1. Comparatively junior inexperienced staff from  outstation should be deputed for day shift \\nworking. \\n2. Teams for different goomties should be so formed as to include at least one staff having \\nprevious experience of NI working. \\n3. For day shift working, more number of staff may be deputed per goomty, if required, to cater \\nfor comparatively inexperienced staff. \\n(D11) Temporary Working Instructions (TWI)  : \\n1. When NI is undertaken, inter – locking provisi ons stipulated in SWR are no longer available. \\nSo the SWR in its existing form becomes invalid. \\n2. TWI is basically meant to replace some portion of Station Working Rules of the station during \\nthe period of NI working. While they need not be as detailed as the original SWR of the \\nstation, nevertheless, they mu st cover all aspects of train operation that are included in the \\nexisting SWR.  \\n3. Static information of SWR will continue to be valid. These include : (i) Inter – station distances. \\n(ii) Description of yard layout. \\n(iii) Level crossing gates. \\n4. TWI is to be read in conjunction with G&SR, Operating Manual, Block Working Manual. It \\nmust also be read along with existing SWR of the station. ', metadata={'source': 'operating manual-traffic.pdf', 'page': 103}), Document(page_content=' 5. Portions of SWR that will get replaced pertain to : \\n(i) Ensuring clearance of running lines. \\n(ii) Granting of line clear. \\n(iii) Reception/despatch of trains. \\n(iv) Working of level crossing gates. \\n(v) All checks that are done by means of : \\n(a) Slots. \\n(b) Lock bars. \\n(c) Point locks. \\n(d) Signals. \\nAll these checks have to be taken care of manually. \\n6. TWI should list out : (i) Number of goomties. \\n(ii) Portions of yard that each goomty would control. \\n(iii) Which goomties are to be involved for reception/departure of a train on/from different lines.  \\n7. TWI should list out different conditions required to  be fulfilled for receptiondespatch of train : \\n(i) How line clear is to be granted/obtained. \\n(ii) How clearance of nominated line is to be ensured. \\n(iii) Procedure for closure of level crossing gates, if any. \\n(iv) How the route is to be set. \\n(v) What are the series of points involved. \\n(vi) Which one of them are to be in normal position and which ones in reverse. \\n(vii) How signals are to be lowered. \\n(viii) Which staff would do what. \\n(D12) Field level Advance Preparation\\n : \\n1. Detailed working instructions clearly specifying the zone of responsibility of each and every \\nstaff and supervisor along with temporary working instructions must be issued well in advance \\nof the NI working. In any case these should  be ready at least 15 days in advance of NI \\nworking . \\n2. Station Superintendent/Traffic Inspector who is overall in-charge should be fully aware of their \\nresponsibilities/duties. Tem porary working instructions sh ould clearly stipulate these \\nunambiguously. \\n3. Each Station Masters/Assist. Station Master, Cabin Man and point man deployed on shift duty should be supplied with copies of temporary working instructions. In addition SM/ASM and \\nCabin Man shall be supplied with yard layout diagrams and pull charts for their guidance. \\n4. The temporary working instruction shall be supplied to SS/ASM/Cabinman and Pointsman in \\nadvance for study by them and for explaining to illiterate staff. \\n5. The instruction should be prepared in Hindi, English and Vernacular language and assurance \\nto the fact that they hav e understood shall be obtained. \\n6. Ready made pull charts indicating normal and reverse position of points for specific routes \\nmust be prepared goomty wise. All such pull c harts should be prepared at least 15 days in \\nadvance. \\n7.

INTRODUCTION \\n  \\n In keeping with global trend, there has been a long outstanding demand of the industry & \\ntrade for transparency in sharing of information to give the customers an up-to date business like \\nenvironment. Railways in this millennium have decided not only to perform the traditional tasks of carrying passengers and goods efficiently, but also to change the mindset of working as a closed system.  The great concern to improve on its mark et share has prompted Railways to have a multi \\npronged approach to its freight policy.  Continuous Cargo Visibility  has always been a critical component of the Supply Chain Distribution \\nManagement System.   \\n To achieve this, out of the stated multi pronged new freight policy, a lot of emphasis has been \\nlaid on establishing a computer ized FREIGHT OPERATIONS IN FORMATIONS SYSTEMS (FOIS).  \\nThe system indigenously developed is fully functional in the B.G. system of Indian Railways being the \\nfirst of its kind in South East Asia.   1. Freight Operations Information Systems Mission – FOIS \\n \\nTo give a total transparent system with continuous Cargo visibility and an up-to date business environment to the Customers with  instant access to information regarding their consignments in \\ntransit for just in time inventory’. FOIS is an On-line Real-Time system based on absolute current State of Art    Technology \\nand efficient Communication system.  \\nA management tool to optimize utilization of costly assets and resources by improving the distribution \\nof Rakes/Wagons & Locos, and also scheduling and Ro uting Traffic in an optimized cost effective \\nmanner.  \\nProvides Continuous Cargo Visibility and enables the Freight customers to  have instant access to \\ninformation regarding the current stat us of their consignments in transit for just in time inventory. \\n \\n2. Strategic Advantages Deri ved From The FOIS System \\n \\n• Extension of the current business practice from bulk movement of freight traffic  in \\ntrain load formations  to piecemeal traffic  by clubbing and moving together similar type \\nof stock in ‘Hub & Spoke’ arrangement to in crease its market share by re diverting \\nhigh profit yielding piecemeal cargo from road to rail.  \\n• Global tracking of consignments in real time Rakes or individual wagons. \\n•  The insight and pipeline of consignments thus captured on the entire BG network is \\nmade available for timely planning and just in time inventory management on a time span cargo movement which may extend to 2 to 5 days  from origin to destination... \\n• Facilitate acceptance (customer’s Orders), billing and cash accountal of freight traffic from identified nodal customer centers which may not necessarily be  the handling \\nterminals. \\n•  Extension of such facilities to customer ’s premises and introduction of e-commerce, \\nbenefitting both IR and the trade & industry, by  eliminating manual transactions which \\nnecessarily add to the burden of logistics management. \\n• Providing requisite Foundation for a total logistics system furnishing real time \\ninformation of the chain of physical distri bution,  an essential element in reducing \\ninventory costs. \\n \\n3. Scope Of FOIS Systems \\n \\nPresently two subsystems of FOIS are already in  use  after extensive field trials and validation. \\nRMS \\nTMS. \\n \\na)  Rake Management Systems –RMS \\n- Rake based consignment tracking and pipeline ', metadata={'source': 'operating manual-traffic.pdf', 'page': 115}), Document(page_content=' - Train/Rake operation \\n- Stock Holding in terms of summary of wagon types \\n- Train and stock Interchange \\n- Terminal Handling performance \\n- Loco holding, outage and power on-line \\n- Reporting to take care of Train/Load on summary basis \\n- Invoice based consignment tracking \\n-      Wagon wise Stock Holding \\n- Reporting of consist Wagon wise - Invoice based loading originating tonnage and revenues. \\n- Wagon wise Interchange \\n- Statement of missing Wagons/wrongly delivered \\n \\nb) Terminal Management Systems –TMS \\n \\n- Computerized   booking and delivery of consignment \\n- Station Accounting \\n- RR generation/Transmission \\n- Improved Customer Interface \\n  \\n4. Crew Management has been developed & is under implementation. Control charting of trains \\ncurrently being done manually will also be integrated with FOIS. \\n  The above two sub systems have been fully developed and tested and are ready for \\nimplementation. \\n 5. FOIS Design Architecture   \\n \\nFOIS is designed and developed in conformity with the state of art technology which is scaleable, \\nmaintainable, with open systems architecture and is based on the Indian Railways organizational \\nhierarchy, its present and future requirements.  Based on the business processes that are being \\nadopted, the business model developed in the FOIS - IT architecture is based on the assumptions: -  \\n \\nThe current business practice of bulk movement in ra ke formation is the accepted norm for future also. \\nAround 80 to 85% of traffic already moves in Rake, majority of which comprises similar type of rolling \\nstock. \\n Global perception is more important, with respect to  tracking of consignment and   Rakes rather than \\nof individual wagon, locomotive and train. The insight and pipeline of consignment and rakes should be seamlessly available. Railways would like to share information on booking and movement of \\nconsignments with individual customers also. \\n  The operations and data capturing, will remain control centric  for train, rake locomotive and \\nstock management and terminal centric  for booking, loading, unloading, and delivery. Taking into \\naccount the spatial distribution of ac tivities, which need to be captured. \\n \\n Integrity of Operation and Commercial dat a is an absolute necessity. RMS and TMS \\napplication are conceptualized, to provide the int egration with the other subsystems as and when \\nthese are developed.  \\n \\n FOIS ultimately expects an event driven integrated reporting in real time, beginning with the tendering of Forwarding note to loading and generati on of invoice, followed by load consists, train \\nordering and departure/arrival of l oad destination, unloading and delivery.  The data thus captured is \\nused for generating associated managerial reports on-li ne information (MIS).  The data will also be   \\nused for expanding the scope to cover other functional areas of the remaining modules and can easily integrate with RMS/TMS using appropriate middle ware Technology for sharing information locally. Therefore, a strategic approach has been adopted to computerize IR operations by implementing \\nRMS/TMS systems in a phased manner using modular approach. \\n 6. FOIS   System Architecture  \\n \\n Key components of the System Architecture  ', metadata={'source': 'operating manual-traffic.pdf', 'page': 116}), Document(page_content=' Intelligent terminals will be placed at the field locati ons to capture the data from the place of activity \\nnamely control offices, yards, goods sheds, C & W depot, Loco sheds etc., and connected to the \\nidentified Application Server through reliable communication links for transaction processing. \\n \\n   Application servers are centrally placed at CRIS office. These servers are connected to the \\nZonal Hd. Qrs., Divisional Control Offices, yards, interchange points, and good sheds etc., with a \\nreliable and integrated network.  The servers are networked amongst themselves and to the central \\nserver for global level transactions.  The central Server provides management Report s at board level and acts as repository of all \\nthe global data and also provides global services to  maintain referential integrity of the databases \\nincluding master files.]  7. Network Topology  \\n \\n In view of the Centralized application archit ecture, a star based network topology has been \\ndesigned.  However, in order to provide alternate paths ( to meet the up time requirement of 99.9%) \\nfrom reporting locations, a mesh has been created wi th in each zone so that every location has at \\nleast two paths to reach CRIS. Each zonal HQ has been connected to central location (CRIS) on high \\nbandwidth pipes.  In addition to this, another zonal location has been connected to CRIS using high \\ncapacity link.  Hence these two high bandwidth links shall cater to the entire transaction load \\ngenerated by a zone. Railwa y telecommunication network, leased lines, DOT, VSAT    Technology   \\nas communication media has been provided for reliable and fast means of data transfer.  8. Phased Implementation – Approach \\n \\nh) In case implementation is attempted for events of all the functions to be reported in \\nreal time, concurrently from day one, t hen the reporting sites to be readied, the \\nassociated communication requirements and the number of staff to be trained assume enormous proportions.  To ensure that the implementation effort is within \\nmanageable limits, one way is to take up, one by one, only limited portions of \\ngeographical territory for computerization at any given time.  On the other hand, if the \\nterritory is small, instances of repetitive data entry increase; resulting in redundant \\nexpenditure on reporting infrastructure that will have no use as the territory expands.  At the same time, if the MIS requirements are to be met in totality, the territorial expansion must ensure that a function is implemented on end to end basis as quickly \\nas possible, otherwise only a truncated pict ure will be available to various levels of \\nusers and the benefits of computerization remain postponed till the entire Indian \\nRailways have been covered.  \\n ii) The FOIS comprises several subsets of functions each meeting a distinct set of \\nobjectives. Certain FOIS subsets presuppo se others to be operational before they can \\nbe implemented.  Loco and wagon based functions presuppose load/train/rake \\nfunctions to be operational.  Goods shed functions expect wagon-based functions to \\nbe in place before they can be implemented. With these assumptions the FOIS / RMS systems have been designed in a modular structure which could be taken up for implementation in a phased manner. \\nFor example:-     Phase I (PI module)  \\n \\nProvides facility for reporting load summary with only wagon type and number of units. Phase II (PII module)  \\n \\nProvides facility for reporting the consists with details of wagon numbers. \\nPhase III (PIII module)  \\n \\n TMS provides facility for good shed functions and generation of RR. \\n \\n9. Implementation Strategy \\n \\nRealizing that functional phasing is the only way to keep the implementation effort within manageable \\nlimit and yet remain meaningful at every stage, FOIS software has been developed as above in three modules such that functions of global utility are implem ented faster from fewer sites. It also takes into ', metadata={'source': 'operating manual-traffic.pdf', 'page': 117}), Document(page_content=' account that the beginning is made from the control offices where computer awareness is of a high \\norder.  The implementation can grow on need basis driven by the Railways themselves.   \\n \\n For timely completion of field implementation, the total involvement and commitment of \\nRailways is very essential from day one.  Therefore, COM’s of Railways have been given the   total \\nresponsibility and charge of implementation of FOIS, to provide for the following:- \\n \\n- Railways to get staff identified and train them to work on PCs \\n- Railways to prepare the sites for installation of hardware including provision of \\nelectrical and civil facilities.  \\n- Maintenance of channels & data com equipment  has been given to CSR of the zones.  \\n- CRIS would provide specifications for the same.  \\n \\n For facilitating this process the organiza tion of CAO/FOIS has been strengthened and made \\nresponsible for coordination, implem entation on All - India-basis.   \\n \\n The software implementation and maintenance sh all remain the responsibility of CRIS.  Pre \\nimplementation training of the required number of st aff (consisting of Core Implementers and Telecom \\nInspectors from each of the divisions), in RMS - phase 1 has been completed by CRIS for all the zonal railways and their divisions. However, Railways will be required to make arrangements through the Zonal Training Schools to train the remaining staff of the concerned categories.   \\n \\n10.

Application/Software \\n \\n RMS module has been developed with GUI interface which is highly interactive, very user \\nfriendly. The software is totally menu driven and navigation is through logically linked tasks. The \\napplication and front end forms for reporting events has been developed in Visual Basic and resides in \\nthe client machine located at the reporting location . Data is stored in the central server locate at \\nCRIS.  \\n1. General Concepts \\n \\n  A Rake is a very generalized term, which refers to any set of wagons moving together and has \\nbeen identified in the system as rake. Wagons can be attached/detached to a Rake. A Rake is identified by a uniquely defined ID number, which remains unchanged through various Load/Empty \\ncycles & movements. A Rake, when given a desti nation, is known as a Load. A Load, when given a \\nloco, is known as a Train. Thus, there can be no Train without a Load & no Load without a Rake \\n(except where a load is mixed and is not identif ied in the system as a rake). With a clear \\nunderstanding of these terms, you enter data through clearly defined “tasks”.  \\n The RMS software has two identifiable cycles- \\n \\n           Train cycle: It starts the moment a load is identified as a train and the following tasks are used \\nfor online reporting: -  \\nTrain Ordering: TO/Call between two crew-changing points. \\nTrain Departure: reports departure. \\nTrain Arrival: reports arrival. \\nTrain Run-through: reports through runs \\nTrain rerouting \\n \\n            Yard Cycle: It starts as soon as a terminating load a terminating load arrives at its destination \\nor a train is cancelled. (i.e. the load is sent to load planning)and the following tasks are used for \\nvarious online reporting:-  \\n \\nLoad Related Tasks \\nInward Number Taking: destination validates consist. \\nLoad Planning: initial activity, following rake assignment. \\nLoad Stabling: run/ordering termination is reported through this. \\nLoad Diversion/Termination/Extension: re ports changes in planned load destinations \\nLoad Yarding: takes a load-to-load planning screen, but will not reflect in stabled position. \\nVehicle Guidance Related Tasks \\nConsist Reporting: originating station report s summary details. (Guidance is also called as \\nConsist). \\nRake Related Tasks \\nRake Formation Details: form/modify rake consist. Movement order: facility to give advance assignments to rake \\nRake Placement/Release: r eporting Load/Empty cycle. \\nRake Dissipation: for generating piecemeal out of rake or for doing away with a rake which \\nhas no wagons left. \\nAfter a load is made ready, loco attached and train ordered \\nAgain the train cycle begins.  \\nLoco Related Tasks \\nAttachment/Detachment of Locos. \\nLoco Reporting: reporting shed activities of loco. \\nLight Engine: reports light engine movements \\nGiven above is the list of tasks that are to be performed on real-time basis i.e. as soon as the \\nevent takes place. \\nDemand :- This function is to be reported at stat ion where the party/consignor registers his \\nDemand for supply of Rake/Piecemeal wagon for loading of goods.

This PC \\nis used for entering (and retrieving) data. Foll owing are the important guidelines for users. \\nPower Connection:  \\nPlease make sure that a data entry PC or a “Reporti ng Terminal” is always kept in the “ON” condition.  \\nThe power feed required is met through a 5A dedicated socket.  \\nPlease make sure that all the different PCs & Printe rs have a separate 5A socket. Don’t use multi-plug \\nadapters.  \\nAlso check up with the Electrical personnel as to  whether your sockets have Earthing arrangement. In \\nabsence of the same, your PC may get damaged. The earthing to neutral voltage not be more than 2-\\n3V. \\nIt is also better to have a MCB attac hed to main power supply point/board. \\nYour AC connection & PC supply must be on diffe rent phases. This saves from fluctuations.  \\nYour PC is not connected to the mains directly. Instead, the Power supply is routed through a UPS \\n(Uninterrupted Power Supply). Please ensure that this  is always done. This saves your PC from power \\nfluctuations as well as gives a power from batteri es for about 20 minutes, in case of power failure. \\nThere should be a power back up, either through AT (OHE) or through Diesel Generator. The change \\nover switch should be close to you.(care to be taken that earthing is proper) \\nIt is a healthy practice to ensure that various powe r chords feeding your PC, Printer etc are neatly tied \\ntogether, rather than strewn all over. If you locate your UPS very close to your monitor, the display will wobble. Please ensure that UPS & Monitor are separated by at least 24 inches. \\nWhen the PC is ON, don’t try to change any connection. This applies equally to not only power \\nconnectors, but also to various chords connect ing different equipments, LAN Cables etc.  \\nWhen turning the PC ON, (if need arises) follow this sequence \\nMains → UPS → Monitor → Printer → CPU. \\nThe reverse is followed when switching off. \\nEnvironment: If an AC is provided, make sure that it is working properly. \\nAC should be on a phase different from the one feeding your PC. \\nThe room should be kept as clean as possible. Dust, smoke particles & moisture cause maximum damage to your PC. So, don’t allow any smoki ng, eating or drinking at the workstation.  \\nNever clean your PC using an organi c solvent (such as Colin). Always use a soft, damp, dirt-free cloth. \\nWhen the PC is not in use, keep it covered with “Dust Covers”.  \\nMake sure that the Keyboard has been supplied with a “Skin” – a tight-fitting plastic covering for \\nKeyboard, which does not stop usage. \\nYour PC should not face direct sunlight. Nor should it be placed so close to window where rains can \\naffect it. \\nCPU (Central Processing Unit) & Monitor should not be placed in such a way that the fans/outlets at \\nthe rear of these equipment get blocked by walls/other objects. \\nVirus Protection: \\nViruses come to you PC through pirated softwares  of games & utilities that you load. Yet another \\nsource is downloading of files from Internet. Once a virus is on a single PC of a network, it spreads on \\nits own to the entire network. Therefore, you must not load pirated software or download wallpapers \\netc from Internet.  Make sure that Virus protection files are loaded on your PC. \\nPlease enable virus scans on data transfers, floppy drive files & CD files. \\nPlease schedule your Virus software to run every day at a fixed time. To do this, open “My Computer”. Double Click on “Scheduled Tasks” Folder. Double Click on “Add Scheduled Task”. This will activate \\n“Schedule Task Wizard”. Click next & select the name of the Anti-Virus program given to you. Keep \\nfollowing the simple steps to schedule your Anti-Vir us to run daily. Once scheduling is done, your PC \\nwill automatically run the program everyday at a given time, as specified by you.  \\nThere is an arrangement whereby we get updated Anti-Virus files every 3 months. These CDs are \\navailable at your Divisional HQ th rough OCC. You must update your anti-virus programs to enable it to \\ntake care of new viruses. \\nThere are tell tale signs of virus on your PC. Please be on lookout for these signs, which are listed \\nbelow: \\n• Unexplained disk drive activity light or floppy drive light \\n• Reduction in RAM Availability \\n• “File Copied” message appears without copying anything \\n• Failure of a memory resident program to operate properly \\n• System behaves slowly or in a chaotic manner ', metadata={'source': 'operating manual-traffic.pdf', 'page': 122}), Document(page_content=' • Bad clusters on the disk \\n• Increased number of files on disk \\n• Increase in size of executable programs \\n• Change in file’s date and time stamp, without modification \\n• Program running slower; taking more time \\n• Program/Data file co rruption/disappearance \\n \\nInternet Connections:  \\nThere should be no Internet connection on your PC.

Your PC is \\nconnected not only to adjacent PC but also to each & every PC on FOIS. (Each PC on the network, \\ntherefore, has a unique identification or Address – known as IP address). This has been achieved by \\nusing leased lines, ISDN connections & VSATs for data tr ansfer. This data transfer rate is higher than \\nPRS system. Also, unlike PRS terminal, your terminal is a full-fledged independent machine. The \\ninterface is Windows, unlike text type processing in PRS.  \\n  Your PC is connected to FOIS through a Router, which is a junction between LAN (Local Area \\nNetwork – connecting all PCs in your premises) & WAN (Wide Area Network – a bigger network which \\nconnects all PCs on the system). A Router does th is mostly through Channels – which are connected \\nto it using Modems. (A channel has two ends. On e end is connected to Router through a Modem in \\nyour premises. The other end is again connected through a Modem to the equipment of Channel \\nProvider, at his premises. This can be S&T or BSNL or any other telephone company). Finally, a Router will have connections with your LAN (thr ough Hub/Switch), Modems (one for each channel), \\nISDN Connections (directly to Route r) & VSAT (directly to Router). All this equipment is collectively \\nreferred to as Datacom Equipment.   \\n \\nRouters: \\n \\nA Router routes\\n the data that you want to send/receive. It is an intelligent device, unlike Hubs & \\nModems. The data is sent & received in data packets. A LAN works below a Router. Data sharing \\nbetween various PCs connected on a LAN is automatic & Router has no role. It is only when the data \\nrequires being sent/accessed from a remote PC/Serve r – i.e. accessing WAN terminals - that Router’s \\nrole assumes significance. Its IP Number specifie s each Router – like all intelligent devices on a \\nnetwork –. This IP Number actually identifies it s Ethernet port. A Router may have WAN, LAN, & \\nVOICE port. A port is actually a point where a channel (through Modem) or LAN or ISDN or VSAT \\nconnection can connect to Router. On Railways, we have two makes of Routers supplied – Cisco & \\nMotorola. \\n \\nRouter has to remain “ON” at all times. \\n  \\nAlso ensure that the power feed is having a proper earthing arrangement. The earthing norm of 2-3V to be maintained. \\n \\nPower supply to Router should be routed through a UPS. Never operate a R outer without a UPS. \\nAlso, wide fluctuations in input voltage can damage the Router. \\n \\nThere should be a power back up, in addition to Normal Power Supply. This could be through Auxiliary Transformers (AT) in OHE area or through a Diesel  Generator Set (DG Set). The change over switch \\nshould be accessible easily.   \\nThe Router should be kept in a dust, smoke & moisture free environment. Please use Racks provided \\nto house the Router. Since Router is expensive & sensitive equipment – which does not require daily maintenance – therefore, it is bette r to leave the equipment undisturbed. \\n  Essentially provide Air-conditioning for routers.  \\nA Router, along with Modems should be placed at a location where it is always accessible to the user. \\nYou actually don’t have to do anything with Router, but  just by looking at various displays & reporting \\nthe same, you will be participating in troubleshooting. For this reason, you must have Router under \\nyour control and not locate it in Test Room.  \\n Some of the Routers have a specialized Port for IS DN. (Not all Routers have it). Unlike all other \\nterminating leads on a Router, ISDN connection gives a higher voltage ( ≈ 100 V). Therefore, if ISDN \\nlead is connected to any other port, that port will burn down. Be careful.   Firm connections of all chords to Router are to be ensured. \\nNothing should be placed on Router. Router should not be dragged.  \\n \\nModems:  ', metadata={'source': 'operating manual-traffic.pdf', 'page': 124}), Document(page_content='  \\nModem (Modulator/Demodulator) is the device throug h which a channel connects to your Router (& \\nthrough it, to your PCs on LAN). It is a very sturdy & maintenance free device. It also requires a dust & smoke free environment. It is normally housed in a Rack along with Router. A lot of information is \\navailable on its front display.  \\n  \\nWe have two types of Modems on Railway – G703 (at service provider’s premises) & V35 (at our \\npremises, with Router). \\n When the channel connected to a Modem is working properly, you will find both “RD” & “TD” glowing & \\nblinking. If it is not so, then there is some problem with channel. \\n As always, you have to ensure that Modem is always kept “ON”. \\n \\nAlso ensure that the power feed is having a proper earthing arrangement.   \\nNever use a metallic brush to clean the surface.  Organic solvents are also not permitted. \\n \\nSince one end of a channel always resides at the channel provider’s premises, therefore you must \\nalso know some simple checks to analyse the channel position. Some of these steps you take in tandem with the operator at other  end, who is observing his Modem. These steps, which are invoked \\nwhen the channel is down (i.e. “line protocol” is down), are Make “LL” (Local Loop) switch “ON”. This gives the status of the Modem & Router. If “TD”, “RD” blinks, \\nthen local equipment is OK. If it doesn’t, then the problem is with Modem/Router.  \\nIn the next step, we make “RL” (Remote Loop) switch “ON”. This checks the local lead condition \\nbetween Modems. However, to get the response of this action, there should be an observer at the \\nother end. If everything is OK, then at the remote end,  “RD” & “TD” will blink. Similarly, remote end can \\nalso give a “RL”, in which you will get blinking “RD” & “TD” on your Modem, if everything is OK \\nbetween two Modems.  \\nIf both “RL” & “LL” give OK results, then the problem  is beyond the Modem at service provider’s end. \\nYou have to take a docket number after registering th e fault with service provider (i.e. S&T or BSNL). \\nIf Modem at the other end is not able to execut e “LL” successfully then Modem at that end is \\ndefective/improperly connected.  \\n \\nIf all loops show positive result & line protocol is still down, try initialising Modem by switching it off & \\nthen on. \\n \\nIf everything gives OK & data is still not able to pa ss through then there may be problem with Router. \\nInform Divisional Control. \\n \\nAlways ensure that all leads are firmly connected. However, no lead should be checked with power at \\n“ON” position.  \\n \\nChannels:  A Channel refers to a leased line dedicated channe l for data transmission. You have two types of \\nchannels – Railway & BSNL. However, as a user you don’t see a difference. Though technically a Channel refers to a leased line channel, in this section we will also cover ISDN & VSAT in it. A channel connects your system through Modems & Rout ers. In addition to l eased channels, you also \\nhave ISDN connections & VSAT (Very Small Apertu re Terminal) connecti ons to enhance your \\nConnectivity. Connectivity refers to the immediate links that your PCs on LAN (at a Node) has with neighbouring nodes. It has been planned that ideally each node has a minimum of two links, each \\ngiving a different route to your dat a – so that data transmission can continue even if one link is down. \\nThis is technically known as Route Diversity. \\n  \\nUnless a Channel is available, data will not tran smit. If your node is connected through two channels & \\none of them is down, you will not know the difference. However, with one channel down, you are in a very precarious position as data entry will stop as soon as the second channel even flickers. It is \\ntherefore important for you to take active interest  in knowing the state of a channel. This can be done \\nthrough “pinging”. Pinging is the name given to sending & receiving a test data packet from one \\ncomputer to another remote PC/Router or to any intelligent device. However, you can ping only if you \\nknow the (IP) address of remote PC or Router. These are listed in Annexure I. You can ping by following command \\n ', metadata={'source': 'operating manual-traffic.pdf', 'page': 125}), Document(page_content=' Start → Run → Ping [IP Address of Remote Router] → OK \\n \\nOnly an entry like “Request Timed Out” or “ ttl expired in transit” indicates failure. \\nVSAT connections can also be pinged. Some othe r important points for VSATs are as follows \\nThe data is transferred directly to CRIS SERVER . This is a sturdy system, which once stabilized, \\nworks trouble-freely. \\n \\nThe earthing resistance should be less than 1 ohm. Neutral to earth leakage should be 2V.  \\nIt should never work without UPS&CVT \\nAir-conditioning is a must.  \\nThe antennae base structure should be firmly fixed and clamped. At the time of installation it should \\nbe ensured that ODU is having its protective laminat ed cover(to protect it from water and dust) OR at \\nleast the rubber cap of Radio Frequency (RF) unit is in place.  \\n \\nThere should be one ladder for antennae access. \\n \\nThere should be a routine of checking the equipments.  It should be ensured that rubber cap of RF unit \\nis in place and the cord going to indoor unit is firmly in place. \\n \\nSimilarly, ISDN connections can directly pass the data, bypassing Router (or more accurately, \\nbypassing Router at that node but connecting to a re mote Router). Only in such ISDN connections \\nwhere Routers are not provided, you will not know the status of channel through pinging.  \\n Please ensure that ISDN connections are always with  power “ON”. Also ensure that ISDN connections \\nare not STD barred.  \\nThough it is not possible for you to know as through which particular channel your PC is transferring \\ndata, the same is always very accurately known to Router. Depending on the channel availability, it \\nkeeps on defining the route dynamically. Thus, if ISDN is available & all other channels are down, \\nRouter shall use ISDN to transmit data. (ISDN conne ction can also be assigned a higher priority by \\nconfiguring the Router). As soon as any of the other channels becomes stable for a predefined time \\ninterval, it again resumes data transfer through that  channel, shutting off ISDN. This is what is known \\nas programming of Router. \\n  ISDN is a secondary channel and since its usage is very expensive so it should be used very \\njudiciously. \\n \\nLAN: \\n LAN connects all your PCs available at a location. However, it need not be confined to a building. It \\ncan be extended to a few kilometers (up to 6 km) also. Such extension is normally through a LAN \\nExtender. Even if PCs are connected through LAN Ext ender, there is no role of Router in sharing of \\ndata among these PCs.  \\nLAN is achieved by using the network card available on your PC. An identical work group is to be \\ndefined on each PC on the LAN so that they are “visible” to all other PCs.  While defining Network Properties on your PC, make sure that only one Gateway (i.e. IP address of \\nyour Router) is defined. Disable DNS.  \\nA PC may be visible on a LAN. However, other PCs can use only those files, folders, drives etc of that \\nPC which the owner of that PC has decided to “Share ”. To share a file, single click on the file name, \\nfollowed by right click. Select “Properties”, followed by “Sharing” tab. Share to  the extent you desire. \\nYou can decide to allow other users to even write on your Hard disk. However, you cannot \\ndifferentiate between your co-users on LAN & other users on WAN!  \\nYou can also share some scarce resources – such as Printers – through this scheme. LAN wiring consists of two parts – fi rst, a CAT5 structured cabling from Router/Hub to I/O box (a 3” x 3” \\nx 2” white box) & second a flexible cable from I/O box to your PC. Please ensure that all PCs at a \\nlocation are connected on LAN.  Ensure that CAT5 cable is mounted on wall properly & is not hanging loosely. \\nEnsure that flexible chord is not stretched. Also ensure that I/O box is located close to your PC.  \\nHubs/Switches are devices for connecting additional PCs to Router’s LAN port. Please ensure that \\nthese are properly mounted on wall.  Uptime: \\n ', metadata={'source': 'operating manual-traffic.pdf', 'page': 126}), Document(page_content=' It refers to the time when a node or a channel remains available for data entry. As explained earlier, it \\nis of utmost importance to know the stat us of availability of equipment for user. \\n You should keep records both of Channel Uptime & Node Uptime. It is easier to maintain record of \\nNode uptime. Simply record in a register the daily position of availability of a node. \\n \\n(Along with the reasons of failure for doing analysis.) It is very essential to keep check on the health of \\nsecondary channel when primary channel is up.   \\n Give summary position of the entire da y to your Zonal OCC at odd hours. \\n For finding the channel uptime, you have to schedule ta sk of pinging, even if your Node is up. Ideally, \\nevery 4 hours, you should ping to adjacent Routers & note the result. This, compiled over entire day, \\nwill give channel availability of each channel at your Node. Record this also in a register, giving \\nmessage to Zonal OCC through Messaging Feature of RMS.   \\nThere should a fixed regime of reporting of failure to  be in place so that in case of a failure trouble \\nshooting is fast. \\n \\nA list of phone numbers of service provider shoul d be readily available both at div headquarters and \\nzonal headquarters.  \\nYou also have to keep tab on the time taken by variou s service providers to attend to your reports of \\nbreakdowns of Routers, Modems, UPS, Printers, PCs etc. This should be in a separate register, which \\nis not to be reported daily to your headquarters  Other Applications: \\n \\nDo not use your FOIS network for any other regular  data transfer programs. This can cause virus \\nthreats, slowing down of application, viti ate OCC tasks & mis-programming of Routers. \\n \\nWithin LAN, you can share information occasiona lly. However, running regular & heavy program may \\nreduce the availability of system for data entry  to FOIS. Please don’t run any heavy or regular \\nprograms on your LAN.  \\nUnless you procure genuine copies of software that you intend to use on a single PC, please don’t \\nload it. In any case, this should never be done on a “Reporting Terminal”.   \\nOther Networks:  \\n Your PC should not have access to another network  – such as Rail net. This makes the network prone \\nto hackers & Viruses. Since the information availabl e on FOIS is confidential, therefore hackers have \\nto be prevented from enter ing our network. This is the reason for having separate LAN and Routers for \\nFOIS.  Do not allow any Internet connectivity.

It is a non signaling system and provides additional \\ncover of safety in train operations to prevent dange rous train collisions caused due to human errors or \\nlimitations and equipment failure. Being the non-si gnaling and inter locking system it does not replace \\nany existing signaling and interlocking system and does not alter any procedures of train operations in \\nvogue.  ACD is a Network of Anti -Collision Devices (ACDs) comprising of a variety of devices such as on-\\nboard (Mobile). ACDs for Locomotives and Guard vans and track-side (Stationery) ACDs, Level \\nOCrossing ACDs, Loco Shed ACDs, Sensor based AC Os and ACO Repeaters. All these work on the \\nprinciple of distributed control systems. All ACDs along the ACDr oute communicate with each other \\nthrough radio communication when they are within a radial range of at least 3 kms. On board \\ncomputers use inputs from Global Positioning System (G PS) for determination of train location, speed, \\ncourse of travel and time. Both mobile and stationary components of  ACO system exchange \\ninformation and take decisions based on train working rules and embedded software to apply brakes automatically without any input from the users. If tw o ACOs are deemed to be at a risk of collision, the \\nACD system activates automatic braking operation to prevent collisions. Loco ACO is designed to interface with various types of braking system of locomotives. \\n \\nSystem provides audio-visual \"Train Approach\" warning to road users at level crossings. At Manned \\nLC Gates, when approaching Loco ACD detects \"Gate Open\" condition, the speed of the train/loco is reduced and kept under a pre-defined speed. Similarly, it can also provide warning and regulate speed in case of movements of land slopes in deep  cuttings that are \"sensed\" through Inclinometer \\ngrids, embedded in such slopes. ACD system does  not interfere with normal working of train \\noperations.  \\nMore than 2,000 Anti Collision Devices have alread y been installed over 2,700 Route Kms of track on \\nIndian Railway system out of which about 1900 Ro ute Kms are on North east Frontier Railway and \\nbalance are on Konkan Railway.

The \\nmost difficult accidents, from investigation point of  view, are the ones where wheel leaves the rail.  \\nSuch accidents can be categorized in four types: \\n \\n1. When one or both of the same wheel-set fall inside the track. \\n2. When the wheel derail without any mark on the rail table. \\n3. When the wheel derails with single flange mark on the rail table \\n4. When a number of wheels derail with mu ltiple flange marks on the rail table. \\n Type 1: When one or both wheels of the same wheel-set fall inside the track: \\n In such derailments the cause of accident is very clear, i.e., spread gauge or may be a remote \\npossibility of shifting of wheel disc on the axle or breakage of axle or journal.  It is generally seen that \\nin such cases of wheel/wheels falling inside the track, the affected rolling stock is lifted with the help of \\njacks and the rolling stock can be lo wered and moved on the same track. \\n \\nIn the case of spread gauge, special care has to be taken for recording the condition of track fittings. Loose keys, signs of rail-chairs shifting on the sleeper , condition of elastic clamps, tie rod cotters etc. \\nmust be carefully examined and recorded. If a wheel starts mounting the rail, its tread lose contact with the rail and entire weight is shifted to this point  of contact on the flange. At this particular moment, \\nthe arrangement of forces is as follows: -       Q  \\n  \\n  μR  \\nIn the above figure different forces shown are as follow:  \\nQ: Instantaneous wheel load \\nR: Reaction of rail  Y: Lateral thrust (flange force) \\nμR: Frictional force between rail and wheel flange (acts upward) \\nμ: Coefficient of friction \\nβ: Flange angle \\nFrom the above simple model, following formula was derived by Nadal in 1908: \\n \\n  Y/Q       tan β -μ/1+μ tanβ \\n \\nThe ratio Y/Q is called derailment coefficient. \\n \\n(While investigating into derailment, all track vehi cle defects and features and operational aspects \\nwhich cause one or more above mentioned factors to occur should be listed as possible contributory \\nfactors. The list of such cont ributory defects and features thus arrived at should be arranged in \\ndescending order of their assessed c ontribution.

Additionally, loco \\nspeedometer chart must be chec ked for last brake application. \\n \\nType-3 When the wheel derails with single flange mark on the rail table .  \\nThis is the most interesting category of dera ilment and requires detailed examination of track, \\nvehicles, loading condition and train operating conditions. First the wheel mount mark itself has to be \\nproperly ascertained. The length of flange mark gives a clue to reasons for derailment. The following factors must be considered after seeing the flange mark: \\n \\n• Long flange mark suggests that the wheel load reduced considerably for a long \\nperiod. \\n• Short flange mark suggests that the lateral thrust increased to a considerably high value. \\n• The weight of the vehicle and speed of the train at the time of  \\n accident affect the impression of flange mark on the rail. \\n   In a number of cases an empty derailed wagon had been pulled to a very long \\ndistance and the wheel mount mark was found but di sputed due to ignorance of the investigating \\nofficials. In all the cases, one must ascertain the first wheel drop mark and then trace back the mount \\nmark. After locating the mount mark, next step is to ma tch it with the wheel that derailed first. For this \\nmatching of damages on sleepers and position of vehicles after derailment will have to be done. \\n \\n  After identifying the point of mount and drop, detailed examination and recording of \\ntrack geometry rolling stock parameters, condition of  loads in derailed as well as non-derailed vehicles \\nand operating conditions has to be done. This record reveals reasons for the accident. The analysis has to be done with a view to find out reasons fo r increase in thrust and reduction in instantaneous \\nwheel load.  \\nType-4 When a number of wheels derail with  several flange marks on the rail table. \\n \\nIn this category of derailment the probable reasons for derailment can be as follows: \\n• Obstructions in the path of wheels. \\n• Disturbed track (work being done on the track or sabotage) \\n• Rail failure \\n• Serious track defect-twist misalignment or formation failure \\n• Buckling of track \\n \\n  In such cases, if there is no obvious reason like obstructions or rail failure, track \\nparameters are of particular relevance and sufficient care has to be taken in recording them. Readings \\nof track geometry is of great importance in est ablishing the behaviour of vehicle just before the \\nderailment. In addition to the readings taken after de railments, records of previous maintenance (rail \\nrenewal, de-stressing etc.) must be perused to asse ss the amount of work done in the last few days. \\n \\nDERAILMENTS AT POINTS AND CROSSINGS:  \\nPoints and crossings are meant for changing the road of a train and it has some discontinuities \\nthereby making it a weak link in track structur e. In a point there are two tongue rails connected \\ntogether by stretcher bars and this assembly is ca lled switch. A pull rod from some distance operates \\nthis switch. Today, most of the points are oper ated by motors and they have some interlocking \\narrangement. The interlocking for motor operated point s is done with a lock bar and it has a detection \\ndevice also to detect proper housing of points. \\n  Tongue rails forming the switch are hinged onto the heel blocks in the rear. The bolts, \\nprovided for hinging the tongue rails, are kept loose for easy operation of switch. After the switch \\narrangement, another important part is the nose of crossing. Here all the wheels traverse the path \\nshown by the switch.  \\n Most of the derailments at point s and crossings either initiate at the toe of the tongue rail or \\nnear the nose of the crossing. Whenever a derailm ent takes place on a point the following checks \\nmust be done:- \\nGauge of point must be checked at four locations:  ', metadata={'source': 'operating manual-traffic.pdf', 'page': 146}), Document(page_content='   \\n• 305 mm in advance of nose of tongue rail \\n• 152 mm inside the tongue rail for straight road and turn out. \\n• At heel for tongue rail for straight road and turn out. \\n• At middle of tongue rail for straight road and turn out. \\n \\n The Gauge must be correct at all places except at the toe where it may be 6 mm slack for \\nhousing the tongue rail. \\n \\n It can be appreciated that conditions created by slack gauge\\' are not permitted near the \\nswitch. IRPWM-1985, Para 237 t\\' (8) (a) and (b) is reproduced below: \\n  “(8) Gauge and Super-elevation in turnouts-(a) It is a good practice to maintain uniform gauge \\nover turnouts. \\n(b) If gauge of track adjoining the points and crossings is maintained wider/tighter than the gauge on \\nthe points and crossings. the gauge on the adjoining tr ack must be brought to the same gauge as in \\npoints and crossings and run out at the rate of I mm in 3 metres to the requisite extent. It should, \\nhowever, be ensured that the same gauge as applic able to the points and crossings is maintained for \\nat least one rail length on either  side of point and crossings.\" \\n \\n In case of derailment suspected to have star ted near the switch of the turnout the following \\npoints need to be carefully examined:   \\n• The condition of tongue rail-whether broken, chipped or bent. \\n• Whether the damage is old or new. \\n• Height of the tip of the switch from top of stock rail. \\n• Thickness of the tongue rail \\n• Any gap between the tongue rail and stock rail \\n• Any damage to stretcher bar \\n• In case of interlocked points, the slackn ess between the  locking  bar slot and slide \\nshould be recorded \\n• The condition of brackets holding the stock rail \\n• Whether the switch jumps up when a wheel passes on its heel. \\n \\n If the derailment is suspected to have started near the crossing the following points must be \\ncarefully checked:- \\n \\n• Condition of nose-wear , breakage, chipped, bent \\n• Reduction in the level of nost as compared with wing rails. \\n• Clearance between wing rail and stock rail (near the nose) on  both sides. \\n• Clearance between guard rail and stock rail \\n• Alignment of turnout to be measured for ch ecking smoothness (with 6 metre chord at \\n1.5 metre intervals) \\n IRPWM has specified a check-list for complete examination of points and crossings.  There is one potentially dangerous structure ca lled diamond crossing, which is generally not \\nprovided on the main line.  A simple diamond crossing has four noses (two acute angle and two \\nobtuse angle), which require a critical watch.  Even a slight damage to these noses or disturbance to \\nthe clearance between stock rails and guardrails make  this diamond crossing unsafe.   The problem is \\nfurther compounded if a diamond crossing has one or tw o slips also.  The curvature of the slip is \\ngenerally so high that these struct ure are not fit for speeds above 8 to 10 kmph.  It is advisable to \\navoid use of these structures. \\nSome Important Defects \\n \\n (A)  Permanent Way \\n \\n• Spread gauge \\n• Gaping in points \\n• Tipping of the toe of switch \\n• Worn out & broken tongue Rail \\n• Excessive clearances of check rail opposite to the nose of the  crossing ', metadata={'source': 'operating manual-traffic.pdf', 'page': 147}), Document(page_content=\" • Loose or slack points connections \\n• Sharp curves with kinking alignments \\n• Worn out Rails \\n• Abrupt introduction of super elevation \\n• Super elevation not corres ponding to speed of the train \\n• Buckling of track \\n• Shearing of fish plate bolts \\n• Subsidence of track \\n• Uneven Cross level \\n• Condition of Ballast \\n• Security fastening deficient/loose \\n \\n  Track defects have a vital role in the ac cident and therefore it is very essential to \\ncheck the various parameters of the track.

Creep is a longitudinal \\ndisplacement of track and is caused by \\n• Temperature variation causing expansion and contraction of the rail. \\n• The tractive forces of locomotive to push the rail backward. \\n• Braking forces of train trying to push the rail forward. The effect of the above forces is \\naccelerated if the rail fasteners are not able to hold the rails properly to the sleepers or rail seat on the \\nsleepers is a damaged or bad joint in the track with out proper expansion gap. \\n \\n Para 242 (6) of IRPWM specifies maximum about of creep permitted as 150mm.

This also happens due to the rise in temperature and other reasons similar to the \\ncreep. The buckling may be horizontal or vertical. Buckling normally happens in the 2nd half of the day \\nmostly, when the track has absorbed max. heat and also near the bridges, level crossings etc. where \\nthe track is firmly held in ground.

The distance betw een adjacent sub-stations \\nmay however be even less depending on intensity of traffic and load of trains. \\n \\nSectioning of OHE:- \\n          To ensure rapid isolation of faults on the OHE and to facilitate maintenance work the OHE is \\nsectioned at intervals of 10 to 15 km along the route. At each such point a 'switching station \\ninterruptors'  usually rated at 600A are provided. The shortest section of the OHE which can be \\nisolated by opening interruptors alone is called a 'sub-sector'.  Each sub-sector is further sub-divided \\ninto smaller 'elementary sections'  by provision of off-load type manually operated isolator switches. \\n \\n At some stations with large yards, alternat ive feeding arrangements are provided so that the \\npower for feeding and yards may be drawn from alter native routes. Normally the switch is locked in \\none position, being changed to the other when required after taking necessary precautions. \\n \\n To meet requirements at electric loco running sheds, isolator  with an earthing device in the \\n'off position is provided. At watering stations manua lly operated interrupters and isolator with earthing \\nheels are provided to enable switching off of the power supply locally and earthing the OHE to enable working on roofs of rolling-stock. There are severa l types of switching stations as detailed in the \\nfollowing paras. \\n \\nFeeding Post (FP):  It is a supply control post, where the incoming feeder link from grid substation are \\nterminated. \\nEach feeder supplies the OHE on one side of the f eeding post through interrupters controlling supply \\nto the individual lines. Thus, for a two track line,  there will be four interrupters at each feeding post. \\n \\nSectioning and Paralleling Post (SP) These posts are situated approximately midway between feeding posts marking the demarcating \\npoint of two zones fed from different phases a ‘\\nparalleling interrupter’  is provided at each 'SP' to \\nparallel the OHE of the up and down tracks of a double track section, 'bridging interrupters'  are also \\nprovided to permit one feeding post to feed beyond the sectioning post upto the next FP if its 25 kV \\nsupply is interrupted for some reasons. These bri dging interrupters are normally kept open and should \\nonly be closed after taking special precautions as detailed in these rules. \\n \\nSub-Sectioning and Paralleling Post (SSP) \\nOne or more SSPs are provi ded between each FP and adjac ent SP depending upon the distance \\nbetween them. In a double track section, normally th ree interrupters are provided at each SSP i.e. two \\nconnecting the adjacent sub-se ctors of up and down tracks. \\n \\nSub-Sectioning Post (SS) \\nThese are provided only occasionally.

The overhead equipment above the tr acks comprises of the following: - \\n a)  A stranded cadmium copper wire of about 65 mm2 section or  stranded \\n aluminium alloy wire of about 116 mm2 section for catenary. \\nb)  A grooved hard drawn copper contact wire of 107 mm2 cross-section (when new) \\nsupported from the catenary by means of  droppers of 5 mm diameter spaced not \\nmore than 9 m apart. \\n \\n2.  The catenary and contact wire together hav e an equivalent copper section of 157 mm2. The \\ncurrent normally permissible on a single track is 600 A approximately, because of equivalent cross-\\nsectional area of OHE. This current limit is based on the temperature limit of 85°C in contact wire. \\nCertain sections in Waltair-Kirandul section have the catenary and contact wires together having an \\nequivalent copper section of 200 mm2. \\n3.  For loop lines, sidings, yards and spur lines excluding the main running lines and first loop or \\nlines taking off from main running line, tramway type OHE having only grooved hard drawn copper contact wire of 107 mm2 section is provided. \\nHeight of Contact Wire  The normal height of contact wire for regul ated OHE is 5.60 m (with 10 cm pre-sag for 72 m \\nspan) above rail level. For unregulated OHE in areas with a temperature range of 4°C to 65° C, this \\nfigure is 5.75 m and in areas with a temperature range of  15 °C to 65 °C, it is 5.65 m. In certain cases, \\nsuch as under over-line structures, the height may be as low as 4.65 m on BG and 4.02 m on MG. For \\npassing oversize consignments on such lines , special precautions have to be taken. \\nSpan of Supporting Mast/Structures  \\n The span normally used for supporting the OHE from masts/structure using the cantilever \\ntype bracket assembly varies from maximum 72 m on straight track to 27 m on curved track, the \\nspans depending upon the degree of curvature. Th e catenary system is normally supported on \\nstraight tracks at maximum intervals of 72 m (63 m on MG) by cantilever type arms fixed to galvanized broad flange or I section steel masts or fabricat ed steel structures. On curves the catenary is \\nsupported at closer intervals, the spans  adopted depending upon the degree of curvature. \\nStagger \\n The contact wire is staggered so that as the p antograph glides along, the contact wire sweeps \\nacross the current collecting strips of the pantograph  upto a distance of 200 mm on either side of the \\ncentre line on straight runs and 300 mm on one side  on curves.

For increasing the speed potential, improved \\npantograph with lower dynamic mass and independe nt pan heads have been used. Further, in order \\nto improve the life of the contact wire, use of carbon  strips has also been tried. Use of carbon strips for \\ncurrent collection has already been adopted in European countries. \\nUse of carbon strips necessitates change in the de sign of the pantograph; the pan head which is more \\nor less rigid in case of steel strip pantograph need s to be made more flexible in the vertical, horizontal \\nand transverse movement for carbon  strip pantographs.

Due to these features, the life of the main \\ncontact achievable is as high as 1 lakh electrical  operations as against 20,000 operations for air blast \\ncircuit breakers.

Transformer  \\nPower to the traction vehicles is available at 25 kV ac single phase from the contact wire. In order to \\nstep down the voltage as well as to control the sa me for feeding to the traction motors, the traction \\npower transformers are provided on the traction vehicles. \\nThese transformers generally have a primary winding, a regulating winding, traction secondary \\nwindings and auxiliary windings. The regulating winding is designed for choosing appropriate voltage \\nfor the traction motors. The auxiliary winding is required for feeding the auxiliary motors on the \\nlocomotive. \\nIn order to increase the h.p. of the locomotives, the traction transformers have been uprated from time \\nto time keeping the overall dimensions unchanged on account of space constraint. The upratings \\nhave been achieved by using increased copper section of the conductor used, improved insulation \\nscheme and in certain cases adoption of aluminium foil wound construction for minimizing the losses. \\nWith the introduction of thyristorised converters, t he design of the traction transformer has undergone \\nsimplification with the deletion of regulating winding. The transformer for thyristorised converter \\nbecomes a two limb construction and traction secondary winding split into 4 windings for two step \\nsequence control. \\nThe traction transformer necessarily has to have forced oil circulation and forced air cooling. For this \\npurpose oil pump, oil cooler and blower form an integral part of the traction transformer. \\nTap Changer \\nTap changer is provided on 25 kV (HT) regulating wi nding of locomotive transformer for controlling the \\nvoltage input to main transformer.  \\nTraction Motor \\nIn case of traction motor great emphasis is being given on improving power to weight ratio, keeping in \\nview the limited space available on locomotive for mounting the same. There is continuous effort to \\nimprove the performance of traction motor by maki ng them lighter/compact, at the same time more \\nreliable. Indian Railways have been adopting th e latest technology available for design and \\nmanufacture of traction motor. Over a period of ye ars the traction motors have become now 2.5 times \\nlighter specially for EMU application. \\nArno Converter \\nArno Converter is a special duty machine for conversion of single phase in-coming supply into 3 \\nphase out- put supply. 3 phase supply is essentially r equired on most of the electrical locomotives for \\ndriving certain auxiliary equipment like blowers and compressors. The function of Amo Converter is to \\nsupply 3 phase power required for these auxiliaries.
